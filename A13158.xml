            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </p>
            <p>The argument of both petitions is one in effecte, and therefore much more needeth not to be ≈øaid now then that which is formerly aun≈øwered to the Ma≈ø≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prie≈øts. Yet becau≈øe all haue not ≈øeene the former pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition and an≈øwer, nor vnder≈øtood their gunpowder, and rebellious practi≈øes; and the≈øe Lay, or rather lame Romane Catholikes, ≈øeeme to ≈øtand more vpon their loyaltie, then the other; I thought it not ami≈ø≈øe, after this late di≈øcouery of their mo≈øt horrible trea≈øons, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulerly to examine this di≈øcour≈øe al≈øo, and with mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginall Glo≈ø≈øes to poynt to the fooleries of their text, which notwith≈øtanding I would not haue all ≈øimple pa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pi≈øts take, as ≈øpoken to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>≈øelues. for my meaning was to touch only the≈øe Petitioners, and ≈øuch as ≈øub≈øcribe this factious Petition.</p>
            <p>Much adoe we haue about toleration of popi≈øh re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, but we may ≈øay, as <hi>Saluianus</hi> lib. 7. <hi>de prouidentia</hi> ≈øaid ≈øometime in another ca≈øe: <hi>vtinam hoc remedium ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lorum, &amp; non diuturna toleratio.</hi> I would this toleration, which they de≈øire, were a remedie of their pretended euills, and not rather a long continued toleration of mi≈øchiefes, and that both in the Church and ≈øtate. For why, I be≈øeech you, may we not ≈øo ≈øay, ≈øeeing no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can be granted, that is either more derogatorie to Gods honor, or more preiudiciall to the Kings ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ie≈øty and ≈øtate, as hath in part appeared by this late at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, and as God willing it ≈øhall at large, with mo≈øte

            <p>This my di≈øcour≈øe, mo≈øt reuerend Father, I pre≈øent to your Honor, as a pledg of my loue, and an acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment of your Lord≈øhips fauours towards me: and the rather, that both your Lord≈øhip and al true Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtians truelie zealous for the cau≈øe of true pietie, and ≈øtudious of the ≈øafety of their countrie, may thereby vnder≈øtand, how much it importeth them all to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur in repre≈ø≈øing ≈øuch notorious in≈øolency, &amp; factious cour≈øes.

It were a matter too ≈øawcy, for wi≈øe, and ciuill men to challenge the king of breach of pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mi≈øe, as they do pag. <hi>8:</hi> and too pre≈øumptuous to rayle on religion publiquelie profe≈ø≈øed, and the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fe≈ø≈øors thereof, to the Kings face, as they do in diuers places. Neither do I think, that all are ≈øo foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>li≈øh, as to make them≈øelues pledges and ho≈øtages for their Ma≈ø≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prie≈øts, ≈øuffering ≈øuch ≈ølippery co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>panio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>s to dominere in their hou≈øes, to confer with their wiues &amp; daughters, to wa≈øt their e≈øtate, while they haue no Counterbond from them, either for the others good behauiour, or theire owne ≈øecuritie. This I am well a≈ø≈øured, that what ≈øoeuer is pretended, this petition neuer came Originally from the heades of lay papi≈øtes. For neyther may ≈øuch men withoute licence, reade <hi>Caluines</hi> In≈øtitutions, nor <hi>Luthers</hi> bookes, nor o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther di≈øcour≈øes written by men of our ≈øide: nor may they take vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them to di≈øcour≈øe of Religion, as the Authors of this petition doe.</p>
            <p>I wold therfore pray the ≈øimpler ≈øort of plain meaning Papi≈øts, not to take what ≈øoeuer is ≈øharpely ≈øpoken again≈øt the Ma≈ø≈øe Prie≈øtes ma≈øked vnder the name of lay papi≈øts, and the ≈øole deui≈øers of this

And again≈øt ≈øuch as ≈øo violently run a cour≈øe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain≈øt truth, and ≈øeek to blow vp the King and State: I doubte not, but all indifferent men will e≈øteeme my ≈øpeech moderate, and this kinde of dealing most fitting and conuenient. What? ≈øhall vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>circumcized Phili≈øtims raile at the people of God, and ≈øeeke our destruction; and ≈øhall not true Chri≈øtians be permitted liberty to repre≈ø≈øe theire in≈øolency, to countermine their vndermining trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øons, and freely to defend the truth?</p>
            <p>When them≈øelues do publi≈øh their petitions, they may not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fu≈øe to haue them publiquelie examined; and no rea≈øon haue they to complaine of wrong, ≈øeeing them≈øelues thus handled, when not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with≈øtanding their wicked intentions, they put forth their Apolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyes, reque≈øts, and di≈øcour≈øes into other mens handes, as if they were mo≈øt loyall and hone≈øt men.</p>
            <p>Hitherto they haue abu≈øed the worlde with a fal≈øe pretence of antiquitie, and fal≈øelie chalenged to them≈øelues the name and ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle of <hi>Catholiques.</hi> They doe al≈øo before ≈øuch, as are ignorant of matters of ≈øtate, ≈øtand vpon termes of loyalty, and loue of theire Prince and country. But now that we are ≈øo farre vrged, we ≈øhall God willing, make it appeare, that their Popi≈øh deui≈øes are nothing but a pack of nouelties latelie brought into the Romi≈øh church, &amp; that their Religion is full of here≈øies, impieties and bla≈øphemies: and la≈øtly that diuers of their practi≈øes are full of Salt peter, and mo≈øt dangerous to the ≈øtate: and that their importunate de≈øires are repugna<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>t both to rea≈øons of religion &amp; ≈øtate, and al≈øo to modest and ciuill cariage.</p>

               <head>Chapter <hi>4.</hi> That to admitte the exerci≈øe of fal≈øe religions formerlie forbidden, is contrary both to chri≈øtian policie, and rea≈øon.</head>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE gentils by the light of rea≈øon perceiued, that religion was not lightly to be changed and god dooth therein taxe his people by his prophet, that they were more ea≈øily indu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ced to change the euerliuing god, then the Heathen nations were to cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>ge their gods. They co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>≈øidered, that ther was but one truth, &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>≈øtantly beleeued, that their religion was true. This was the rea≈øon why the <hi>Romanes</hi> did ≈øo viole<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>tly per≈øecute the primitiue chri≈øtians, and refu≈øed the ≈øuper≈øtitious rites of <hi>Bacchanalia,</hi> which priuilie began to creepe in among the people.</p>
               <p>But Chri≈øtians proceede vpon better groundes of policie in prohibiting the exerci≈øe of all fal≈øe religions. For fir≈øte they con≈øider, that the wrath of god is reueiled from heauen again≈øt ≈øuch, <hi>as with-holde the truth in vnrighteou≈ønes.</hi> But who doe herein offend more greeuou≈øly then they, which either grant liberty to fal≈øe teachers, or winke at the exerci≈øes of a wicked and fal≈øe Religion? doe not they manife≈øtly giue way to errors and ≈øtop the cour≈øe of truth?</p>
               <p>Secondly they know, well that god <hi>de≈øpi≈øeth tho≈øe, which de≈øpi≈øe him,</hi> as we reade, 1. <hi>Samuel.</hi> 2. and that hee ca≈øteth ≈øuch out of his fauour, as are neither hote nor colde. Jf then ≈øuch as regard not to ≈øee god rightly ≈øerued, re≈øt de≈øpi≈øed, and luke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warme profe≈ø≈øors are reiected: how will it goe with ≈øuch, as are
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:177776:11"/>colde in ≈øetting forth true Religion, and care not what fal≈øe doctrines are ≈øtirring abroade in the world?</p>
               <p>Thirdly they vnder≈øtand the greeuous threatnings of the law again≈øt all idolatrous &amp; fal≈øe wor≈øhip of god. I <hi>am a iealous god</hi> ≈øaith the Lord, <hi>and will vi≈øit the ≈øinne of the Fathers vpon the Children to the third and fourth generation of tho≈øe, that hate me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fourthly as there is but one god, ≈øo they know, that there is but one true religion. Chri≈øtian policie therefore may teach them to admit no religion, but that, which is founded vpon the writings of the Apo≈øtles and Prophets, and which they are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øolued is mo≈øt true.</p>
               <p>Fiftly diuer≈øities of religions breed di≈øtractions of mens minds and diuers ≈øeditious ≈øtirres, and tumultes, as the leagues of <hi>France,</hi> and practi≈øes of the popes agentes in <hi>France, Flan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, England, Scotland, Germany</hi> and other countries doe declare. of late the Papi≈øts ≈øeeking to replant their ≈øuper≈øtition in Engla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>d, went about to ≈øet the land on a flame, and to drown true religion in blood. But wi≈øe politicks are by all means to roote out the≈øe ≈øeedes of Ciuil di≈ø≈øen≈øion.</p>
               <p>Sixtly all changes in matters of ≈øtate are dangerous. But ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitte a fal≈øe and erroneous religion, where nothing but the true faith hath been profe≈ø≈øed. &amp; then no doubt but the cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>ge will be great.</p>
               <p>Finally nothing is more ab≈øurd, then to change lawes with out cau≈øe, and to admitte a religion condemned by lawes, and to re≈øtore ≈øuch as are condemned by the ≈øtate. For that is rather a ≈øubuer≈øion, then an alteration both of lawes and ≈øtate. If then we re≈øpected nothing but the danger of ≈øtate in the mutation of religion; yet woulde all pollitick and wi≈øe men bee well adui≈øed howe they admitted a newe and fal≈øe religion contrary to that which hath formerly beene receiued by the ≈øtate.</p>

                  <hi>Thirdly</hi> it is ridiculous to tru≈øt to the popes meanes in iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, when he vnder≈øtandeth neither councels, nor v≈øeth any good meanes to know the truth. Nay wee knowe, what≈øoeuer means are pretended, that the pope either ru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>neth vpon his own head, or followeth a few carnall cardinals, or contentious friars.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly</hi> it is a blocki≈øh thing, to di≈øtingui≈øh the Pope from his iudgement. For ≈øo the pope ≈øhould be found to be without iudgement, &amp; iudgme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>t without the pope. That this iudgmente is not infallible, we gather infallibly out of his manifold erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous doctrine &amp; iudgme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>t. The ≈øame appeareth al≈øo by his fal≈øe decretalls, and the variation of the popes iudgement.</p>
               <p>Fiftly the ≈øcriptures being con≈øigned by god, and deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to the church by the prophets and Apo≈øtles, need no new
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:177776:14"/>con≈øignation, nor taxation of the pope. Nay very ab≈øurd it were, if lawes receiuing their ≈øtrength from the gouernors, the ≈øcriptures ≈øhold not be authenticall without the approbation of the pope, who for the mo≈øte part vnder≈øtandeth no ≈øcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, nor hath ≈økill to reade them in theire originall tongs.</p>
               <p>Sixtly the Pope is for the mo≈øte parte ignorante both of the ≈øence of ≈øcriptures, &amp; of the principal poynts of religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing ≈øtudied neither. And very ridiculous it is, after plain words of ≈øcriptures, and expo≈øition of coun≈øels and fathers, to runne to the pope for re≈øolution.</p>
               <p>Finally the re≈øolution of matters of fayth dependeth not vpon the determination of the pope, or his adherentes, who are departed from the fayth, but vpon the word of god, that in matters of ≈øaluation is plaine, and better expounded by the learned, and by auncient fathers, then by partiall Popes and their adherentes. <hi>Stapletones</hi> groundes therfore are fal≈øe and erroneous. Neither are the principles deliuered by others more certaine.</p>
               <p>The conuenticle of <hi>Trent ≈øe≈ø≈ø.</hi> 4. dooth ≈øeeme to found the faith of the Church partly vpon ≈øcriptures, and partly vpon vnwritten traditions. But <hi>fir≈øt</hi> the ≈øame alloweth no ≈øcriptures authenticall, but ≈øuch as are found in the old latine of the bible which in many pointes digre≈ø≈øeth from the originall bookes, and is much inferiour vnto them.</p>
               <p>Secondly they allow no interpretations of ≈øcriptures, but ≈øuch as are con≈øonante to the doctrine of the church of Rome. which in matters of controuer≈øy are mo≈øt peruer≈øe, erroneous and ab≈øurd, as may appeare by diuers particulers <hi>in the ≈øuruey of popery.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly they make the bookes of <hi>Tobiah, Iudith, Eccle≈øia≈øti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eus, Wi≈øedome and Machabies,</hi> together with certaine frag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments not found in the original books of the old te≈øtame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>t, equal to other ≈øcriptures alwaies reputed canonicall; the which is reproued by the common con≈øent of auncient fathers, and ≈øee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth repugnant to rea≈øon.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly</hi> vnder coloure of traditions they thru≈øt vpon the
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:177776:14"/>Church, not onelie diuers Fables, and ≈øuper≈øtitious toyes, but al≈øo a greate part of the errors of the church of <hi>Rome. Finally</hi> they talke of Apo≈øtolicall and Eccle≈øia≈øtical traditions, and yet can not certainely deriue them, eyther from the Apo≈øtles, or from the Ancient catholike Church. The≈øe foundations, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore are ruinous, and rather ≈øerue to prooue the erroncous do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of <hi>Antichri≈øt,</hi> then the faith of <hi>Christe Ie≈øus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Canus</hi> in his booke <hi>de locis theolog.</hi> among his principall groundes and proofes of chri≈øtian religion, reckoneth, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the acts of Councels and writings of the fathers, but al≈øo the authority of ≈øchoolemen and canoni≈øts of profane writers, and of humane rea≈øon, yea of the popes, and moderne church of <hi>Rome.</hi> Now what I be≈øeech you, is more vncertaine, then to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vpon the vncertaine actes of councels, and connterfact wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings ≈øet out vnder the name of fathers?</p>
               <p>Againe what is is more vnrea≈øonable, then to bring forth the pope &amp; his complices for witne≈ø≈øes or iudges in their owne cau≈øe? Lex dei ≈øaith <hi>Athana≈øius, Apolog</hi> 2. <hi>inimicum, ne que te≈øte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> ne que iudicem e≈ø≈øe vult. the lawe of God admitteth not our ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to bee either iudges or witne≈ø≈øes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Finally</hi> naturall rea≈øon is blind in the cau≈øe of true religion. &amp; profane men write profanely. The≈øe groundes therfore, as they are faultie, cannot ≈øerue for immoueable groundes of the chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtian fayth.</p>
               <p>Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>monly all papi≈øts doe build their faith, not ≈øo much vpon ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie ≈øcriptures, as vpon vnwritten traditions, popi≈øh decretals, ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing miracles, feyned vi≈øions, &amp; the Romi≈øh churches Practi≈øe. But theire miracles and reuelations haue for the mo≈øte parte no better authoritie, then from the forged and lying legendes of ≈øaintes. the fal≈øhhood of their Decretalls and traditions is declared by the writings of auncient fathers. the practi≈øe of the moderne Church, is contrary to the apo≈øtolike and catholike church of old time. For in that Church we neither finde any vniuer≈øal pope with triple crown &amp; guard of Swizzars, nor any Romi≈øh ma≈ø≈øe, nor popi≈øh indulgences or purgatory, or ≈øuch like tra≈øh.</p>
               <pb n="20" facs="tcp:177776:15"/>
               <p> Vpon the≈øe fal≈øe and erroneous grounds it is no maruell, if they haue framed to them≈øelues a mo≈øt fal≈øe and erroneous religion, as may appeare by the≈øe particulars. Concerning ≈øcrip<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tures they teache, that they are no perfect canon of our fayth. and <hi>next</hi> that they are not authenticall to vs, vnle≈ø≈øe they be con≈øigned and deliuered to vs by the Pope, and his adherents. <hi>Thirdly</hi> they ≈øay that the Latin tran≈ølation is authenticall, which they doo not affirme of the originall books. <hi>Fourthly</hi> they ≈øay, they are ob≈øcure and hurtfull.</p>
               <p>La≈øtlie they permit them not to bee read publikely in tongues vnder≈øtood of the multitude. But the Apo≈øtle 2. <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. ≈øayth, <hi>They are able to make the man of God perfite,</hi> and none but here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tikes, as we may read in <hi>Ireneus,</hi> euer accu≈øed them of in≈øuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency. Secondly as lawes, ≈øo ≈øcriptures haue receiued theyr ≈øtrength from the author of them, that is from the holy gho≈øt. And tho≈øe are very ab≈øurd, that do beleeue the Pope ≈øpeaking in his decretalls, and will not beleeue God ≈øpeaking in holy ≈øcriptures. Thirdly all the fathers prefer the originall books of ≈øcripture before the tran≈ølations. Fourthly the word of god in ≈øcriptures, is called light, and the food of the ≈øoule. Who then that is not led by the ≈øpirit of Satan, can repute them ob≈øcure or hurtfull? La≈øtly neuer was it taught or hearde in auncient times, that ≈øcriptures were publikely red in tongues not vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtood.</p>
               <p>Secondly they giue to Chri≈øt in the ≈øacrament a body, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther felt nor ≈øeen, nor any way like to our bodies. For what man J be≈øeech you, euer had a body, that was in many places at once, and yet filleth no place? they holde al≈øo that being in his mothers womb, he was <hi>vir perfectus,</hi> that is a grown man; and that, <hi>as man, he was omni≈øcient and knew all things.</hi> His of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of mediator≈øhip they communicate vnto the virgin <hi>Marie</hi> and other ≈øaints, and to Angells, and ≈øomtime ≈øtick not to call ≈øaints <hi>their redeemers,</hi> as <hi>Bellarmine</hi> in his fir≈øt book <hi>de iudul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gentijs</hi> confe≈ø≈øeth. To make a trea≈øure of indulgences they mix the merits of Chri≈øt and his ≈øaints together, as if Chri≈øts merits were in≈øufficient. Their Ma≈ø≈øeprie≈øts, as they ≈øay, are after the
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:177776:15"/>order of <hi>Melchi≈øedech.</hi> Finally, they make them mediators for Chri≈øts body, as the≈øe words of the Ma≈ø≈øe declare, <hi>≈øu≈øcipe hanc oblationem &amp;c.</hi> and again, <hi>≈øupra quae propitio &amp; ≈øereno vultu re≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picere digneris.</hi> That is, <hi>receiue this oblation,</hi> viz. of Chri≈øts body and blood. And again, <hi>Looke vpon it with a fanourable and ≈øerene countenance,</hi> Of which doctrines no one is true, and diuers are bla≈øphemous and impious.</p>
               <p>Thirdly they ≈øay, the Pope is ≈øaint <hi>Peters</hi> ≈øucce≈ø≈øour, and Chri≈øts Vicar, albeit he neither teach the go≈øpell, nor admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni≈øter the Sacraments, nor re≈øemble them almo≈øt in any thing. Him al≈øo they make the heade ≈øpou≈øe and foundation of the vniuer≈øall church, albeit he can ≈øhew graunte for none of the≈øe prerogatiues. They teach further, that he is aboue general coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels, and hath power to depo≈øe kings, and that his lawes bind mens con≈øciences. but ≈øuch doctrines are not only erroneous but al≈øo ab≈øurd.</p>
               <p>Fourthly they ca≈øt out of the catholike church all, that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fe≈ø≈øe not their faith, although elect to life, and contrarywi≈øe, make reprobate per≈øons, hereticks, and wiched men profe≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øing the Romi≈øh faith, and communicating with the Romi≈øhe church true members of chri≈øts body: they hold al≈øo that the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike church is alwayes ≈øo vi≈øible, that euery man may ≈øee it and di≈øcerne it. Finally they ≈øhut the catholike church within the limits of the Romi≈øh church. Matters repugnaunte to holy ≈øcriptures, and no way agreeing with the nature of the true, ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike and apo≈øtolike church, nor very well with rea≈øon.</p>
               <p>Fiftly mo≈øt fal≈øly they teache, that the Pope onely hath power to confirme generall councells, and that no man els ought to ≈øummon them, and prae≈øide in them. They hold al≈øo, that the conuenticles of <hi>Laterane, Con≈øtance, Florence</hi> and <hi>Trent,</hi> are comparable to the fowre fir≈øte generall coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cells.</p>
               <p>Sixtly they make their followers belieue, that the moderne church of Rome differeth not from the aunciente Romane Church, and that the ≈øame is guided by gods ≈øpirit, and cannot erre. But their erroneous doctrine different from that which <hi>S.
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:177776:16"/>Paul</hi> taught the Romans declareth the contrary.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Commonly they take to them≈øelues the name of Catholikes yet their doctrine of the ma≈ø≈øe, of their half communions, ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the ≈øacrament, merites of congruity and condig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, of Popi≈øh indulgences, wor≈øhippe of images, and ≈øuch like was neuer receiued of the Chri≈øtians of all times and pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</p>
               <p n="8">8. <hi>Par≈øons</hi> in his booke of 3. <hi>conuer≈øions,</hi> giueth out, <hi>that Saint Peter and Eleutherus</hi> did teache the moderne Romane faith, to the aunciente Britones, and <hi>Au≈øten</hi> the monke to aunciente Saxons. But hee faileth in his proofes, and with a harde and bare face telleth nothinge, but bare and improbable lies.</p>
               <p n="9">9. They teache their followers to wor≈øhip ≈øaintes, and to ≈øay Ma≈ø≈øes in their honour, and to go on pilgrimage, and to offer to them, and confirme the ≈øame with fal≈øe and counterfet tales of Saint <hi>George, Chri≈øtina, Catherin, Margaret, Dorothey,</hi> and ≈øuch like legendes; confirming fal≈øe doctrines with fal≈øe tales.</p>
               <p n="10">10. Their doctrine of 7. Sacraments is mo≈øt fal≈øe. For no where can they ≈øhew where Chri≈øt in≈øtituted eyther the form or mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of all the≈øe ≈øacraments, or promi≈øed grace and iu≈øtification to all the≈øe ≈øacraments.</p>
               <p n="11">11. Fal≈øely and di≈øhonorably they teache, that brute bea≈øts ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the ≈øacrament, eat al≈øo Chri≈øts body.</p>

               <p n="13">13. They teach their folowers to make grauen images, and to wor≈øhip them. yet god in his law expre≈øly forbad the wor≈øhipp of them.</p>
               <p n="14">14. God commaunded his people to ≈øweare by his name. they teach their di≈øciples to ≈øweare by Saints and other crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</p>
               <p n="15">15. Fal≈øely they teache ≈øubiects to rebell again≈øt theyr Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces excommunicate by the Pope, and that the Pope hath power to a≈ø≈øoile them from their allegeance, a doctrine fal≈øe and ≈øedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious.</p>
               <p n="16">
                  <pb n="23" facs="tcp:177776:16"/> 16. They teach, <hi>that concupi≈øcence in the regeneras, is no ≈øin,</hi> and that the virgin <hi>Mary</hi> was not conceiued in ≈øinne. Which holy ≈øcriptures condemne as crroneous.</p>
               <p n="17">17. The ≈øtate of perfection they place in the vowes of monkes and friers, as if their rules conteined more perfection, then the go≈øpell.</p>
               <p n="18">18. Their iu≈øtification they place partly in charity, partly in their own works, and hope thereby to merit heauen. but the law pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nounceth them accur≈øed, that abide not in all the words of the law to do them.</p>
               <p n="19">19. Charity, they ≈øay, is the forme of faith; and nothing els but the grace of God. But this vtterly de≈øtroyeth grace.</p>
               <p n="20">20. They doubte not, but that they are able to ≈øatisfy for all ≈øins committed after bapti≈øme. but true chri≈øtians beleeue, that by Chri≈øts ≈øtripes they are healed.</p>
               <p>Finally all tho≈øe doctrines, which the papi≈øts teach contrary to the faith of the church of <hi>England,</hi> are fal≈øe and erroneous: as is demon≈øtrated in diuers ample treati≈øes publi≈øhed again≈øte them.</p>

The auncient fathers of the Church, and Bi≈øhoppes of <hi>Rome</hi> neuer thought, that any one bi≈øhop had authority aboue a generall councell. The ≈øift canon of <hi>Nice</hi> forbiddeth to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue any, that were excommunicated by other Bi≈øhops. The 6.

The councell of <hi>Eliberis</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demneth the ≈øuper≈øtitious lighting of candles in churchyards, and pictures in churches. The councell of <hi>Gangra</hi> taxeth ≈øuch, as di≈øpray≈øe mariage, or de≈øpi≈øe the oblation of maried prie≈øts, or refu≈øe to eate fle≈øh, or condemn ≈øuch as weare common ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parell. The councell of <hi>Laodicea</hi> condemneth the wor≈øhippe of angels. Neyther is there any abu≈øe in Popery, that is of any an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity, but lightly the ≈øame is taxed in ≈øome ancient councel. The popi≈øh wor≈øhip of angells, images, cro≈ø≈øes, and ≈øuch like, halfe communions, ≈øtraunge and vnknown tongues, and other abu≈øes of popi≈øh religion likewi≈øe are either not knowne, or generally condemned by the fathers.</item>
                  <item>5.

               <p>

               <p>But ≈øuppo≈øe his maie≈øty and the ≈øtate were not of a contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry religion to the pope; yet it ≈øhall be prooued, that popery is aduer≈øe to Kings, that like well inough of that religion. For fir≈øt all kings liuing vnder the popes obedience, are the popes ≈øub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects. <hi>Boniface the</hi> 8. declareth it in the chapter <hi>vnam ≈øanctam. ext. de maior &amp; obed.</hi> where he ≈øaith, <hi>it is nece≈ø≈øary to ≈øalnation for all men to be ≈øubiect to the Pope.</hi> Now what greater indigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, then to make kings the popes va≈ø≈øalls and ≈øubiects?</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>Bellarmine lib.</hi> 5. <hi>de pontif. Rom. c.</hi> 6. ≈øayth, <hi>that the pope hath power to take away kingdomes from ≈øome, and to bestow them on others.</hi> The ≈øame doctrine is al≈øo maintained by <hi>Robert Par≈øons</hi> in his ≈øeditious book of titles. He doth al≈øo traiterou≈øly affirme, <hi>that the people may ≈øometime lawfully proceede against princes. VVilliam Ro≈ø≈øe</hi> in his book <hi>de iu≈øtareip ≈øupra reges im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pios &amp; haereticos authorit. c.</hi> 2. affirmeth impudently, <hi>that the right of all the kings and kingdomes of Europe, is layde vpon this foundation, that the ≈øtate or people may depo≈øe their kinges.</hi> But grant this; and then are kings tenants at the popes, and peoples will. For what is more ea≈øy, then to impute grieuous crimes to princes, if the pope or ≈øeditious mutins lift to quartell with them?</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>Bellarmine lib.</hi> 5. <hi>de pontif. Rom. c.</hi> 6. determineth, <hi>that it is not lawfull for Christians to tolerate a king, that is an infidell, or an heretike, if he go about to draw his ≈øubiects to his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.</hi> The papi≈øts therefore, as we ≈øee, are taught to make it a matter of con≈øcie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>ce, to depo≈øe their kings, and the ma≈ø≈øeprie≈øts ≈øet them on to rebellion. <hi>Pius the fift,</hi> excommunicated all ≈øuch as would not take armes again≈øt Queen <hi>Elizabeth.</hi> and <hi>Clerke</hi> and <hi>VVat≈øon</hi> fir≈øt, and lately <hi>Percie</hi> and <hi>Cate≈øbie,</hi> and theyr complices attempted the Kings de≈øtruction, albeit, they ≈øay, he is not declared excommunicated. Nay admit a Prince were not aduer≈øe to the pope in religion; yet if the Pope pretend any
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:177776:28"/>matter of quarrell vnto him, his ≈øubiects are ≈øtirred again≈øt him and hee is excommunicated, as may appeare in the Duke of <hi>Ferraraes</hi> ca≈øe, excommunicated by <hi>Clement the</hi> 8. becau≈øe he wold not deliuer vp into the popes hands, his dukedome of <hi>Ferrara.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fourthly, ≈øuppo≈øe a king keepe good corre≈øpondence with the Pope; yet he is not within his kingdome, as papi≈øts teache, to make eccle≈øia≈øticall lawes. nor may refu≈øe to obey the popes eccle≈øia≈øticall lawes.

               <p>Sixtly the Pope in <hi>c. quia nonnulli. de immunitate eccle≈øiae.</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empteth the goods and po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øions of Clergy men from tolle and cu≈øtome Doth it not appeare then, that Popi≈øh religion de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priuing the King of halfe his reuenewes, doth al≈øo weaken his e≈øtate, and make him oftentimes vnable to defray his ordinary charges?</p>
               <p n="7">7. In all ≈øtates where popery is profe≈ø≈øed, a greate part of the kings reuenewes is taken from him, and be≈øtowed vpon the pope, and his kingdome is thereby much impoueri≈øhed.</p>
               <p>Finally did the King neither re≈øpect his Royall authority, nor his enemies; yet if he meane to ≈øecure him≈øelfe from the

We haue iu≈øtified our charge in diuers treati≈øes both in latin and Engli≈øh, and yet they an≈øwere nothing particulerly.</p>
               <p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly</hi> the pope and ma≈ø≈øeprie≈øtes make merchandi≈øe of mens ≈øoules, and make little con≈øcience to buy and ≈øell chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, altars, dignityes, heauen, grace and all ≈øpirituall thinges. They ≈øpoyle the poore, the widdowe and fatherle≈ø≈øe, and for maynteinaunce of their owne e≈øtates, make hauocke of Chri≈øtian mens e≈øtates. Haue they then rea≈øon, to ≈øue for ≈øuch a bargayning and ≈øpoyling religion?</p>
               <p n="5">5.

               </p>
               <p>Sixtly we finde by proofe, that Ma≈ø≈øe-pree≈øts and <hi>Jebu≈øites</hi> haue combined the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>≈øelues with foreign enemies, &amp; haue ≈øought the de≈øtruction of the ire ≈øouereigne princes, &amp; the thraldome of their natiue country to ≈øtrangers.

               <p>Finally papi≈øts haue no rea≈øon to a≈øke that of vs in England, which them≈øelues deny to vs and our brethren in <hi>Spaine</hi> and <hi>Italie.</hi> There they will not cea≈øe their butcherly proceedings, nor put downe their hou≈øes of Inqui≈øition. Neither will they be induced to ≈øu≈øpend their penall lawes made again≈øt true Chri≈øtians.

               </p>
               <p>But if papi≈øts wil needs, vrge things vnrea≈øonable, then mu≈øt they vnder≈øtand, that true Chri≈øtians haue rea≈øon to reiect their treacherous, fal≈øe, erroneous, new, ab≈øurd, ido latrous and bla≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemous religion.</p>
               <p>And next, that his Maie≈øty hath iu≈øt cau≈øe to abhor the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cti≈øe of that religion, that (as hath bin fore≈øhewed) maketh him the Popes va≈ø≈øall, and taketh away halfe his authority, halfe his ≈øubiects, halfe his reuenues, and bringeth the re≈øt into que≈øti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Now his Maie≈øty is in no daunger by the grace of God. if he can ≈øuppre≈ø≈øe the growing faction of Antichri≈øt. <hi>Sixtus Quintus</hi> in his declaratory Bull, anno.

But let Ma≈ø≈øeprie≈øts gather their bands of ≈øeditious per≈øons together and then both prince, and ≈øtate ≈øhal incur great hazard.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, the preachers of the Catholike faith haue good occa≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to oppo≈øe them≈øelues again≈øt the≈øe wolues, that ≈øeeke to enter vpon Chri≈øts flock. They ≈øeek to alter both religion and ≈øtate, and will not re≈øt before they haue depriued al true pa≈øtors

               <p>Fourthly, Wi≈øe politikes may not admit a religion, that will cau≈øe dini≈øion, and trouble the peace of the ≈øtate. Neither may they tolerate ≈øuch as depend on ≈øtrangers, and concurre with forain enimies.</p>

                  <item>3.

                     <p>In the entrance of his matter he maketh greate bragges, telling his frend, <hi>that this petition, or apology</hi> (he knoweth not whether to call it) <hi>is ≈øo conformable to rea≈øon, ≈øo ab≈øolute in forme of the petitioners ≈øubmi≈ø≈øion, and ≈øo admirable for the a≈ø≈øurance by them offered for theire preestes and pastorus, that the publi≈øhing thereof cannot but giue content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, in his opinion, to all ≈øorts of men.</hi> But his performance is nothing corre≈øpondent to his greate countenance.

                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly</hi> the ≈øubmi≈ø≈øion, that they make, is very defectiue co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>≈øidering theire denyall of the Kings authority in Eccle≈øia≈øt icall cau≈øes, and their de pendance vpon the Pope, that clai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth a ≈øuperiority ouer the king. But did they ≈øubmit them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelues
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:177776:36"/>wholy to his maie≈øty, yet ≈øhoulde they doe nothing but that which is required of all good ≈øubiects.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Thirdly</hi> theire admirable a≈ø≈øurance is mo≈øt admirably ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous: For who doth not wonder and laugh, to heare a≈ø≈øura<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>ce offred for the life of ≈øo great a King, and ≈øo potent a ≈øtate, by a few thridbare fellowes, we know not, who they are? the parliament hou≈øe had beene blowne vp, who ≈øhoulde haue ≈øued their bonds? who ≈øhould haue brought them into the Starchamber for periurye? Againe when the Pope ≈øo ea≈øily di≈øpen≈øeth with oathes and di≈ø≈øolueth contracts, what rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øon hath any Chri≈øtian to depend either vpon him, or his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herents. for either oth, promi≈øe or bond?</p>
                     <p>Be≈øides all this, our prologue, where hee thinketh him≈øelfe horribly eloquent, ≈øpeaketh playne contradictions, &amp; foole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries. For fir≈øte if the petitioners had ≈øuch rea≈øon, as he preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth, what ≈øhould they neede to make a ≈øubmi≈ø≈øion, as ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing committed ≈øome greate crime? againe what ≈øubmi≈ø≈øion can a ≈øubiect make, to his ≈øouereine, that it is not required of him by duty? thirdly ≈øuch as make ≈øuch ab≈øolute ≈øubmi≈ø≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, as he talketh of, neede nor to put in bonds, or pledges. Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally it is foolery to thinke either that papi≈øts are true <hi>catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likes,</hi> or that ≈øuch, as ar truly informed of the continual practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øes of the <hi>fierye Iebu≈øites</hi> and ma≈ø≈øeprie≈øtes, agayn≈øte the ≈øtate, will like of their vnrea≈øonable reque≈øtes, and no man can take them to bee wi≈øe, that charge their iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges with praeiudice before hearing, but to ≈øay or ≈øignify, that nothing can ≈øati≈øfie the ≈øtate, <hi>but the blood and vtter beggary of Catholikes.</hi> or rather papi≈øts, is plaine villany, and not to be proued again≈øte any gouernor of this ≈øtate, No, they de≈øire their reformation, and not their de≈øtruction or hinderance, and much it were to be wi≈øhed, that Percy and other papi≈øts had been no more malitiou≈øly affected to vs, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> we to them. Alledging rea≈øons for the publi≈øhing of this treati≈øe, he di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puteth like a wilde man, running far beyond his witte &amp; rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øon. fir≈øte hee ≈øaieth that <hi>the publi≈øhing of this Apology cannot but tend much to his maie≈øties honor, and more to his ≈øati≈øfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:177776:36"/>and ≈øecurity:</hi> as if tho≈øe did honoure him, that charge him with breach of promi≈øe, &amp; note him with the ≈øtain of here≈øy &amp; hatred to catholike religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>, as the petitioners do. Further what ≈øecurity and ≈øati≈øfaction can tho≈øe yeelde his maie≈øty, that e≈øteeme neither othes nor bonds, when the pope con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremandeth them? but did they meane to keepe both; yet prinate mens bonds are no ≈øecurity for ≈øuch a king &amp; king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. They talke J confe≈ø≈øe, of <hi>loue and deuotion</hi> to the king. But it appeared but little, by the practi≈øe of <hi>Brooke, Clerke, and VVat≈øon</hi> fir≈øt, &amp; les lately by the trea≈øon of <hi>Percy, Cate≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bie</hi> and Faux, who of meer loue ≈øought to blow vp the king &amp; the whole parliament. to omit to ≈øpeake of their ≈øecret com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>binations and practi≈øes, it is no good ≈øigne, that they ≈øeeke to ≈øati≈øfie the King, and to ≈øerue him deuoutly, when they ≈øeek to ≈øet vp a religion di≈øplea≈øing to God, di≈øgracefull &amp; hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to the King, and mo≈øt praeiudiciall to his ≈øubiects.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly</hi> He ≈øuppo≈øeth the Prelates of the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> cannot with rea≈øon di≈øallowe this petition, <hi>≈øeeing no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is required at theire hands, but a rea≈øonable conference, and ≈øati≈øfaction in poynts of their mi≈ø≈øion and vocation.</hi> But it ≈øeemeth he meaneth to giue them but little ≈øati≈øfaction; that refu≈øeth to giue them theire due titles, and telleth them of, I know not what <hi>wealth, plea≈øures and pallaces</hi> prete<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>ded to be enioyed by them. Hee is al≈øo very ignorant. that imagineth, that the teachers of the truecatholike faith, can abide a fal≈øe wicked, idolatrous, hereticall, &amp; bla≈øphemous religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>, or true ≈øubiects trea≈øon and rebellion, and very impudent to call true Bi≈øhops in que≈øtion for theire vocation and mi≈ø≈øion, hauing no colour of defence eyther for the mi≈ø≈øion and vocation of Ma≈ø≈øe Prie≈øtes, to ≈øacrifice for quicke and deade, as for the Pope to rule the whole Church, or for the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinalls to practi≈øe the troubles of Chri≈øtendome. Further he was not wi≈øe to talke of <hi>Bi≈øhops winess</hi> being allowed by <hi>≈øainte Paule,</hi> ≈øeeing the periured <hi>Romi≈øh</hi> prei≈øtes for≈øwearing mariage and ≈øwearing continency, doe notwith≈øtanding keep concubines, whoors, and <hi>Barda≈ø≈øaes.</hi> As for the cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:177776:37"/>of our prelates, and mini≈øters, it hath been often and ≈øufficiently iu≈øtified already, and ≈øhal be againe, when the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tru≈øion of the pope, and his pole≈øhorne crewe, of ≈øacrificing preee≈øts into the Church ≈øhal not by any means be maintei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, or coloured.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Thirdly</hi> he ≈øeemeth very carefull, not to offend <hi>the Puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanes,</hi> as he calleth them. But it is offence inough, to giue the names of faction to true Chri≈øtians. Furthermore, if the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pi≈øts be no better able to pleade for them≈øelues and theire religion, then the≈øe petitioners haue done; not only ≈øuch, as they call <hi>Puritanes,</hi> but al≈øo all other good Chri≈øtians will condemne them to be neither half ≈øubiects, nor condicionall ≈øubiects, nor ≈øubiects at all. As for their religion it groweth euery day more odious and execrable then other.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Fourthly</hi> the ≈øchollers of <hi>Cambridge</hi> and <hi>Oxford</hi> of all men re≈øt wor≈øt ≈øati≈øfied with this petition, being voyd both of lear<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ning and rea≈øon. as for the conceipt which ignorant crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures haue of ma≈ø≈øe pree≈øts, they regard it not, knowing the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> to be but ≈øhallowe fellowes in diuine matters, though very profound in rebellions and treacherous practi≈øes. mi≈øerable are they, that followe ≈øuch guides, and tru≈øt ≈øuch fal≈øe fugi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue compagnions.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Fiftly</hi> the Artizans and prentizes of <hi>London</hi> would make a wi≈øer ≈øpeake, then this petition. ≈øo ≈øeely defences are therin made for the popi≈øh pree≈øts, that how ≈øo euer they thought on them before, they cannot chu≈øe now, but both cry out a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain≈øte them and ≈øtoppe them, as fal≈øe fugitiues, ≈øeditious traitours and profe≈ø≈øed enemies to their prince and country. In the meane while the ma≈ø≈øe pree≈øts haue litle cau≈øe to tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>k <hi>Iohn Lazy,</hi> that maketh them pleade theire cau≈øe before arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zans and prenti≈øes, who generally dete≈øt them and theire ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hominable doctrine and practi≈øes, and hope to ≈øee the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> ≈øhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly hold vp their hands at the barre for trea≈øon.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Finally</hi> the papi≈øts at home and abroad will be very ≈øory to ≈øee theire cau≈øe ≈øo nakedly handled, and ≈øo weakely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended; and, if they be wi≈øe, will cur≈øe him, that publi≈øhed ≈øo

As for the example of <hi>Saint Alba<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>
                        </hi> and of his teacher, it fitteth the papi≈øts in no ≈øorte. Tho≈øe two knew no one poynte of that wicked doctrine of papi≈øts, which the Church of <hi>England</hi> condemneth, neither was <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bane</hi> martyred for the popes quarrell, or the doctrin now co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teined in the decretales, but for the faith and doctrine of <hi>Chri≈øt</hi> and his Apo≈øtles, being as loyall to his gouernors as the <hi>Jebu≈øites</hi> and their complices, are peruer≈øe and di≈øloyall. And therfore at vnawares, where the prologue wold v≈øe the example of the <hi>primitiue church of England,</hi> he printeth <hi>priuatiue church,</hi> ≈øhewing him≈øelfe to be a member rather of the popes priuatiue church of <hi>England,</hi> that is depriued &amp; woulde depriue Chri≈øtians of all true faith in veritie of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and ≈øincerity in conuer≈øation, then of the true primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue Church founded by <hi>Chri≈øte,</hi> and gouerned by the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtels and their true ≈øucce≈ø≈øors.</p>

                     <p>Finally it is no new matter, to make motions for re≈øtrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the in≈øolency of the ma≈ø≈øeprie≈øtes and their adherents. For if the≈øe petitioners be not old, ≈øuch motions were made before they were borne. King <hi>Henry the</hi> 8. at the motion of his ≈øubiects repre≈ø≈øed ≈øuch. as ≈øhold attempt to maintain the popes authority, which is a main ground of popery. And long before his time were lawes <hi>of proui≈øions, and praemunire</hi> made, to ≈øtop the popes encrochements and dayly do recu≈øants giue occa≈øion to make new lawes again≈øt them. But admit ina≈ø≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prie≈øts and their adherents and the Popes truely deuoted creatures had been excluded out of parliaments, and that in bills &amp; books they had been charged <hi>as ≈øectaries, ≈øuperstitious per≈øons, hereticks and idolaters;</hi> and further, that his Maie≈øty had bin moued to take a cour≈øe with them, and the parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to aggrauate their penaltyes. and to prouide for the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution of lawes again≈øt them; yet haue the≈øe lame witted lay papi≈øts no cau≈øe, eyther to make the≈øe outcries, or to pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>li≈øh the≈øe ≈ølanderous libells, not onely to the di≈øgrace of our
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:177776:43"/>late gratious Queen, and <hi>King Edward</hi> that excellent ≈øpirite, but al≈øo again≈øt his maie≈øty, as if he meant to giue intertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to mi≈øcreants, and knew not how to keepe mea≈øure in puni≈øhing papi≈øts and other ≈øectaries and heretikes. For fir≈øt the Parliament is no place for ≈øuch as loue ≈øtrangers, better then their owne princes, and depend vpon forrayners, rather then their countrimen. Secondly papi≈øts are no catholikes, nor were parliaments founded eyther by ≈øuch as beleeued the filthy doctrine of popery pomped out of the popes bre≈øt in the conuenticle of <hi>Trent,</hi> nor for ≈øuch caitiffs &amp; mi≈øcreants as beleeue that doctrine.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly if ≈øuch as in England adhere to the Pope, and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øitiuely hold his doctrine, be called <hi>hereticks, ≈øectaries, ≈øuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitious per≈øons and idolaters,</hi> they are not wronged. For the ≈øame is clearly demon≈øtrated in diuers treati≈øes, and part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in this an≈øwer. And litle are the≈øe lame petitioners able to ≈øay for them≈øelues to the contrary. Nay they haue fauor, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øidering their intelligence and practi≈øes of late with the pope and his agents, that they are not called far wor≈øe.</p>
                     <p>La≈øtly they haue no rea≈øon to complaine of penall lawes made again≈øt lay-papi≈øts. for the penalties are only pecunia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and very remi≈ø≈øely pur≈øued. but the bloudy inqui≈øitors, and the popes adherents murdre and ma≈ø≈øacre all, that profe≈ø≈øe true religion, in places where they command, and this had <hi>Percie</hi> and his compagnions doon in England, if they had pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uailed. Further, them≈øelues will not deny, but that idolaters, heretikes and ≈øectaries may lawfully be puni≈øhed. And if they ≈øhould deny it; yet woulde the examples and practi≈øe both of <hi>Hezekiah, Io≈øiah,</hi> and other godly kings before Chri≈øts time, and of <hi>Constantine, Theodo≈øius,</hi> and other chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtian emperors ≈øince chri≈øtianity began to be profe≈ø≈øed, plain<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly proue it. But it hath been and ≈øhall alwayes be plainly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, that papi≈øts are ≈øectaries, ≈øuper≈øtitious per≈øons, heretikes, and idolaters.</p>
                     <p>Their feare therefore, lea≈øt God wold-be offended with them for their ≈øilence in this cau≈øe, is ≈øuper≈øtitious and very
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:177776:44"/>fooli≈øh. For god is rather di≈øplea≈øed with ≈øuch, as ≈øeeke to erect open idolatry, and to maintaine gro≈ø≈øe ≈øuper≈øtition and here≈øie, as the≈øe ignorant lay papi≈øts, or rather lame Ma≈ø≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prie≈øtes ≈øeek to do; then with ≈øuch, as keep them≈øelues within the li≈øts of their ignorance, and hold their peace.</p>
                     <p>Secondly true it is, as they ≈øay, that their cau≈øe is poore, and more porely defended. And therefore great ≈øimplicity haue they ≈øhewed in prating of things aboue their capacity, and for this cau≈øe they ≈øtand condemned by all true Chri≈øtians, which wold haue liked much better their ≈øober ≈øilence, then their violent and fooli≈øh libells.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly their Children, whom the≈øe petitioners, that deuide them≈øelues from gods church, do deuide from the Chri≈øtian world, as being no part of it, ≈øhall in time to come haue iu≈øt cau≈øe to cur≈øe ≈øuch parents as bring them vp in ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance of true religion, and open idolatry. And if they haue grace, will wi≈øh their babbling parents had neuer medled in this de≈øperate cau≈øe.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly ≈øo far are they from making any iu≈øt defence a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain≈øt their aduer≈øaries, that they giue both them, and others iu≈øt cau≈øe to in≈øult and tryumph, ≈øeeing that the wittes of lay papi≈øts and their teachers beeing ≈øommed and pre≈ø≈øed toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, no drop of rea≈øo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> or piety hath proceeded from them, to ≈øea≈øon their vn≈øauory religion.</p>
                     <p>Finally they confe≈ø≈øe, <hi>that they ob≈øerue no decorum,</hi> and yet profe≈ø≈øe, <hi>that they will not examine curiou≈øly, that which by their aduer≈øaries hath beene thundred out against them, nor di≈øpute in moode and figure with them.</hi> And yet they pretend to be <hi>de≈øirous to giue his maie≈øty all po≈ø≈øible contentment,</hi> and <hi>an accompt of their beleefe and religion, and a ful and ample ≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity and ≈øati≈øfaction,</hi> But if they ob≈øerue no <hi>decorum,</hi> it is not like they will content his Maie≈øty; and hardly will they giue ≈øati≈øraction to ≈øo learned and wi≈øe a prince without cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious examination of matters obiected. They mu≈øt al≈øo di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute, if not in moode and figure, yet in ≈øome better forme, then now they do, if they will either proue vnto vs their di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>figured
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:177776:44"/>and euil qualified religion, or els iu≈øtifie vnto his Maie≈øty the rea≈øo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>s of their rude reque≈øt, that is not only ≈øub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øcribed, as approued by ≈øub≈øcriptions <hi>of a thou≈øand hands,</hi> (as that was of the <hi>Millenary mini≈øters,</hi> of which the≈øe lay pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pi≈øts talke idelly) but al≈øo with the terror of many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øands of the popi≈øh faction, as it were obtruded to his Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtie.</p>
                     <p>So we may ≈øee, that the≈øe petitioners are able to bring nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther truth, nor rea≈øon for the iu≈øtification of their cau≈øe kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping ≈øilence, when they ≈øhould haue ≈øpoken, and ≈øpeaking nothing to purpo≈øe, when they re≈øolued to breake ≈øilence. But if we plea≈øe to examine the true cau≈øe both of their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer ≈øilence, and this pre≈øent petition; we ≈øhall find, that their ≈øilence proceeded partly from their great occa≈øions beeing bu≈øied in diuers practi≈øes again≈øt the ≈øtate, as the≈øe horrible trea≈øons lately di≈øcouered do declare, and partly from the lewdne≈ø≈øe of their cau≈øe, that by farre better orators, then the≈øe laymen, cannot be defended. Contrarywi≈øe the occa≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of their petition is not any wrong offered by vs, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a wrong intended by them, and that both to his maie≈øty and to the ≈øtate, while bragging of the numbers, forces and corre≈øponde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>ce with ≈øtrangers, they endeuor to ≈øtrike a terror into his maie≈øty, and buzzing the≈øe fooli≈øh tales into the ears of the multitude, de≈øire to trouble the peace of the ≈øtate. But the ≈øtate of things being well known, neither ≈øhall his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ie≈øty haue cau≈øe to feare their threats, nor the people rea≈øon to beleeue their fooli≈øh tales. For as they feede them≈øelues, (like as all fugitiues and malcontents do) with a fond conceit of their owne ≈øtrength without grounds of rea≈øon, ≈øo they feed their readers with words, and ≈øhewes, without any ≈øound demon≈øtration of any point of their erroneous religion. God grant, that the ≈øimple ≈øeduced papi≈øt may as well apprehend it, as we ≈øhall prooue it; and then will they hereafter be more wary, how they venture their ≈øtate and ≈øoules vpon the ma≈ø≈øe-prie≈øts warrant, who vpon the hazard and lo≈ø≈øe of others, doe
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:177776:45"/>reape no ≈ømall aduantage now, and ≈øeek to bring all into ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenture hereafter.</p>

                     <hi>Fourthlie</hi> they require vs <hi>to ≈øhew a Commi≈ø≈øion from God,</hi> if we meane to conuince the papi≈øts, <hi>that they haue not true ≈øcriptures, or interpret them not right,</hi> or <hi>that they are idolaters, or hereticks:</hi> a deui≈øe likely to proceed from ≈øuch idle heades.

What needeth then this extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary authority?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fiftly</hi> they tellvs, <hi>that we had our ≈øcriptures from Rome,</hi> and <hi>had been ≈øcripturele≈ø≈øe, if we had not receiued them from thence He ≈øayth al≈øo, that the ≈øame bible, which Angu≈øtine brought into England, is yet. re≈øerued by gods e≈øpeciall prouidence.</hi> But fir≈øte it is not materiall, from whence Chri≈øtians receiue ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ≈øcriptures. The <hi>Romaines</hi> receiued them from the <hi>Iewes</hi> and yet I trow Par≈øons and <hi>Coletou,</hi> as they are turned <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mani≈øts,</hi> will not turne <hi>Iewes. Secondly</hi> that the <hi>Britous</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued the ≈øcriptures from the Romanes, it is not likely, they being, as the common report goeth, conuerted by <hi>Io≈øeph of Arimathaea.</hi> Neither doe the≈øe petitioners ≈øhew, where the Bible is to be foud, that was brought in by <hi>Au≈øten</hi> the Monk, nor doe they make proofe, that this which they ≈øhew, is the the ≈øame Bible, which <hi>Austen</hi> brought in. Jf it bee the old vulgar tran≈ølation, it is not likely, that <hi>Gregory</hi> ≈øent it. For he doth not alwayes follow that tran≈ølation. Heere al≈øo they tell vs, that <hi>we haue reiected and di≈øcanonized</hi> diuers <hi>bookes of
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:177776:54"/>≈øcripture, becau≈øe they be expre≈ø≈øe te≈øtimonyes againste our reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,</hi> which it plea≈øeth them to cal <hi>new and negatiue.</hi> But nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doe we reiect any booke of canonicall ≈øcripture, nor can any argument be drawne from the bookes apocryphall added in the vulgarlatin tran≈ølation to the old te≈øtame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>t, that doeth hurt vs. Furthermore if we do onely deny the here≈øies of the papi≈øts, then doe we not frame any new religion vnto our≈øelues. and if the papi≈øts affirme matters not known to fathers, then is theire religion new &amp; po≈øitiue, if not wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked in the ≈øuperlatiue. For the ≈øence of, ≈øcripture they tell vs that <hi>we haue onely the warrant of our priuate ≈øpirit,</hi> and <hi>they the a≈ø≈øistance of gods holy ≈øpirit promi≈øed to his Church.</hi> But ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øurdly they talke of the interpretation of ≈øcriptures follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing therein the priuate ≈øence of a ≈øencele≈ø≈øe pope, and nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the interpretation con≈øonant to the meaning of gods ho<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly ≈øpirit ≈øpeaking in ≈øcriptures, nor to the iudgement of fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers vpon whome they bragge mo≈øt fondly. La≈øtly they tell vs againe of <hi>parliaments and princes</hi> and ≈øay, that <hi>for one of ours, they haue an hundred,</hi> but they ≈øhew them≈øelues ≈øhame le≈ø≈øe, to ≈øpeake vntruth without any ≈øhew of proofe. For if they looke into all hi≈øtories, they ≈øhall not finde eyther par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament or prince within this realme, that allowed the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked decrees of the conuenticle of <hi>Trent.</hi> Neither did the clergy or the vniuer≈øityes of England euer approue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>. Here againe they they tell vs of <hi>a child King,</hi> and, <hi>woman Queene,</hi> as if they had Queens, that were no women, or di≈øallowed of the ≈øucce≈ø≈øion of children to their fathers. So their fift rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øon is very childi≈øh.</p>
                  <p>Their ≈øixth rea≈øo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> had been more allowable, if they could haue proued theire antecedent. For if <hi>their faith, had been that, which Saint. Paule ≈øo highly commendeth,</hi> and which was fir≈øt taught the Engli≈øh by <hi>Gregorie;</hi> then ≈øhould wee not much contend with them about matters of fayth. But helas poret ≈øoules, the≈øe laypapi≈øtes read not <hi>S. Paules</hi> Epi≈øtles, nor canne they tell, what he taught. and as for their Ma≈øters, they ≈øhall proue them≈øelues de≈øperate fellowes, if th√®y take vpon them
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:177776:55"/>to proue their tran≈øub≈øtantiation, and ma≈ø≈øing ≈øacrifice, and other poynts of popery out of S. Paule. they ≈øhould al≈øo but a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bu≈øe their readers, if they ≈øhould vndertake to proue, that popery is Catholike doctrine, as hath been often ≈øhewed. Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally if <hi>Gregorie</hi> the fir≈øte were iudge, yet ≈øhould they nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther proue the popi≈øh wor≈øhip of images, nor the vniuer≈øall head≈øhip of the pope, nor the inui≈øibility and impalpability of Chri≈øtes body in the ≈øacrament. the contrary rather, out of <hi>Gregoryes</hi> doctrine may be concluded.</p>
                  <p>The 7. rea≈øon is nothing els but a repetition of matters for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly denyed. They ≈øay <hi>we haue receiued our Bible, our go≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, and the canons from the Church of Rome.</hi> The truth is, that all true Chri≈øtians haue receiued both the Bible &amp; the Go≈øpell from Chri≈øt, and his Apo≈øtles-likewi≈øe we haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued auncient canons from auncient general councels, &amp; from the ≈øame the Church of Rome hath receiued both lawes and canons. But the doctrine of the modern churche of <hi>Rome</hi> concerning the 7. ≈øacramentes, halfe communions the carnall eating of Chri≈øtes body with the mouth, and ≈øuch like My≈øteries of the ma≈ø≈øe they are contrary both to ≈øcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and actes of councels, and were neuer knowne to the auncient church of <hi>Rome.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In theire 8. rea≈øon they affirme, <hi>that the Romi≈øh Church is our Mother Church.</hi> But then is ≈øhe a cruell mother, that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øecuteth and murthreth her children. Of the old <hi>Roman</hi> Church diuers nations receiued the faith, and therefore to them ≈øhe might be reputed the Mother church, and ≈øo his maie≈øty meant, when he ≈øpoke of the old church of <hi>Rome.</hi> But this later <hi>Romi≈øh</hi> church is rather a ≈øtepmother, then a mother, and rather the mother of fornications. as Saint John calleth her, or the mother of errors, as <hi>Francis Petrarch</hi> cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth her, then the mother of Chri≈øtians. nay we haueby di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers rea≈øons demon≈øtrated, that ≈øhe is neither the mother church, nor Chri≈øts church, but the whore of <hi>Babylon,</hi> and Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagogue of <hi>Antichriste.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Their ninth rea≈øon is drawne from the maner of the fir≈øte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>
                     <pb n="101" facs="tcp:177776:55"/>ari≈øing, and condemnation of here≈øyes. For if there neuer yet aro≈øe any here≈øy, but both the names of the authors, and of the councells that condemned them, were well known: then if neither the authors of the ma≈ø≈øe, or of Purgatory, or of pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers to ≈øaints can be named, nor any councell found out that condemned them, then they ≈øuppo≈øe, that the≈øe poyntes came from Chri≈øt, and the apo≈øtles. But by the ≈øame rea≈øon hee mighte prooue that the here≈øie of the <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelikes, Collyridians, Me≈ø≈øalians, Nudipedalls, Nazarites, Apo≈øtolikes,</hi> and diuers of that ≈øorte came from <hi>Christ</hi> and the Apo≈øtles. For neither is <hi>Coleton</hi> able to name the fir≈øt authors of the≈øe here≈øyes, nor excepte it bee the <hi>Angelikes</hi> condemned in the councell of <hi>Laodicea,</hi> can hee ≈øhew, that any of the≈øe hereticks were condemned by coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels. Further wee ≈øhew, who were the fir≈øt deui≈øers of the ma≈ø≈øe, and the≈øe lay papi≈øts confe≈ø≈øe, that the author of <hi>euery little ceremony</hi> and the time thereof is known. we knowal≈øo, that purgatory for ≈øati≈øfaction for te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>poral pains after that the guilt of ≈øin is remitted, &amp; praiers to ≈øaynts was fir≈øt deui≈øed by ≈øchoolmen among chri≈øtians, &amp; by idolaters among Heathen men.</p>
                  <p>Their la≈øt rea≈øon is deriued from the fruites of true religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which, as they ≈øay <hi>are loue, vnity, concord, piety, acts of cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, and deuotion, as fasting praier, almes, building of mona≈øte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryes, erecting of vniuer≈øities, founding of Ho≈øpitals, conuerting of Nations,</hi> and ≈øuch like. But fir≈øt the erection of mona≈øte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, and ≈øuch like dennes of ≈øuper≈øtitious per≈øons, and <hi>Sodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mites,</hi> is neither a worke of Charity, nor deuotion. <hi>Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> the≈øe fruites of religion, that are heere mentioned, neuer proceeded from the modern ≈øuper≈øtition of <hi>Rome.</hi> And that is mo≈øt apparent, not only by common experience, but al≈øo by the te≈øtimony and confe≈ø≈øion of papi≈øts them≈øelues. In Jtaly &amp; other countries, where popery mo≈øte reigneth there is little true loue, no vnitie, nor concord either among the teachers, or among their followers, no ≈øteppe of chri≈øtian piety, no acts

Their fa≈øts ar ≈øuper≈øtitious their alms ar phari≈øaical, &amp; for the mo≈øt part euil be≈øtowed.

                  </p>
                  <p>If then the papi≈øts vpon pretence of the≈øe ab≈øurd allega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions de≈øire conference or di≈øputation, then is their ca≈øe de≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate, and their hopes frutele≈ø≈øe.

For we are not hardly entreated to di≈øpute, nor loth to be heard, and now if the≈øe ≈øuppliantes or theire teachers think they can do any ma≈øte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryes, let them propo≈øe their argumentes to the view of the world in writing, that all men may know the cau≈øe, and wee a≈ø≈øure them, they ≈øhalnot want an≈øwere by tongue &amp; penne. and if that will not ≈øerue, then let them procure vs the like ≈øecurity and liberty in <hi>Spaine</hi> and <hi>Italy,</hi> that they de≈øire in <hi>England</hi> and, then they ≈øhall not be refu≈øed.</p>

                  <p>La≈øtly, if we compare popi≈øh recu≈øants eyther with aunci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, or moderne true Chri≈øtians; we ≈øhall ea≈øily perceiue a mayn difference betwixt them. For neither doe we read, that ancient or later Chri≈øtians did murther their kings, that were Heathen, nor that they thoughte it lawfull to doe ≈øuch an act, as the leaguers of <hi>France</hi> did, nor that they allowed either the breach of oathes, or the rebellions of ≈øub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects again≈øt their kings, nor that they beleeued tho≈øe treche<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rous poynts of doctrine, which papi≈øts of late both beleeue, and teach.</p>
                  <p>Now then let vs proceed on with our di≈øcour≈øe, and con≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, whether the≈øe lay papi≈øts haue either an≈øwered the≈øe ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iections, or broughte any matter ≈øufficient to cleare them ≈øelues, and their con≈øorts from the iu≈øt imputations of infide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, and di≈øloyalty toward their princes. Both which poynts may be re≈øolued by examination of the particuler poyntes of this fift chapter, wherein they tell fir≈øt, <hi>that before their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtrainte for recu≈øancy ≈øome of them bare offices in the common wealth, and were dignified by the Queen,</hi> and that others had <hi>there putation, of wor≈øhipfull and hone≈øt men.</hi> But if they me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>t to haue iu≈øtified their former cariage as they pretended &amp; promi≈øed; then ≈øhould they haue told vs of their loyal affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:177776:64"/>to their prince, and of theire good ≈øeruices performed for their country. They ≈øhould al≈øo a≈øwell haue mentioned the cau≈øe of populer recu≈øants, as of the gentlemen. But herein they altogether fayled. For neither do they clear them≈øelues nor their co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>≈øorts of tho≈øe trecherous practi≈øes &amp; doctrines formerly noted, nor are they able to bring proofe of either good affection or good action &amp; ≈øeruice performed for their prince &amp; country. But where they talk of the <hi>diguifiing of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny recu≈øants by the Queene;</hi> in≈øteed of di≈øcharging them≈øelues they charge the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>≈øelues with great vnthankfulne≈ø≈øe and di≈øloy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty, that alwaies hated and per≈øequuted her, which cea≈øed not to dignify and honor them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly</hi> they ≈øay <hi>their behanior after theire re≈øtraint was ≈øuch as became Catholike Christians towards christian ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gi≈øtrates with all humility, re≈øpect, modesty and ≈øubiection.</hi> But this would, rather haue be≈øeemed ≈øome others to ≈øpeak, then the laye papi≈øtes: who for want of good neighbors ruune out into an high commendation of them≈øelues. Further more neither are pri≈øoners much to be commended for car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying them≈øelues mode≈øtly and re≈øpectiuely, ≈øeing pri≈øons at no places for men to exceed, and grow proud &amp; rebellious, nor did the papi≈øts (here fal≈øely called Catholikes) keepe them≈øelues in ≈øo good temper, and ordre, but that they were to be charged with diuers intelligences, corre≈øpondences, &amp; practi≈øes with the enemies of the ≈øtate. as appeareth in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordes concerning <hi>Throckmorton, Arden, Someruille, Babing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, Abington, Parry, Brooke,</hi> and others. And although for want of meanes and occa≈øions they broke not forth alwaies into open action, yet their mode≈øty &amp; ≈øubiectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> did neuer ≈øo far re≈øtrein the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>, but they thought it lawful to kil and murder, &amp; depo≈øe princes exco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>municated by the pope, &amp; vnlawful to obey ≈øuch without di≈øpe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>≈øatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>, e≈øpecialiy in eccle≈øia≈øtical cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øes. that therfor which they talk of <hi>obeying princes not for anger but for con≈øcience ≈øake,</hi> and of their carriage <hi>without ≈øhadowe of di≈øloyalty, and</hi> of <hi>theire integrity</hi> and <hi>vnimpeachable de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meanor,</hi> is nothing el≈øe, but a vaine brag without colour or
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:177776:64"/>≈øhadowe of mode≈øty. For their con≈øcience is ruled by the popes will, and their practi≈øes, trea≈øons, and rebellions are recorded both in ≈øtory, and in the Crown office. Further<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more their treacherous doctrine agayn≈øte the authoritye of Kings is publi≈øhed in their owne bookes, and cannot be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed by them≈øelues.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly they tell his maie≈øty, what offers were made by certaine recu≈øantes in the ile of of Ely, and by the lord <hi>Vaux</hi> anno 1588. when the Spani≈øh and the popes forces came a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain≈øte theire country. but many things are often offered, that are ≈ølenderly performed and ≈øuch no doubt, would the ≈øeruice haue been that is or was offered by them, who ≈øea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red more the Popes thunderboltes, then the princes double cannons, and onely de≈øired to free them≈øelues out of pri≈øon, that they mighte after take part with the ≈øtronger. to de≈øire to bee <hi>placed in the forefront of the battel in theire ≈øhirts,</hi> they had no rea≈øon, vnle≈ø≈øe they had meante after they hadde put of their armes and clothes, to runne awaye more ligtly. My Lord <hi>Vaux</hi> was ≈øo good a man of warre, that I woulde wi≈øh no greater benefit to England, then that all our ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myes were ≈øuch. But ≈øuppo≈øe ≈øome few recu≈øants did offer to ≈øerue the Queen; yet neither had ≈øhe rea≈øon to tru≈øt them, nor we to beleeue, that all the re≈øt of the recu≈øants meant to ≈øerue her faithfully, being ≈øworn va≈ø≈øals to the pope her ≈øworn ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my. Vnhappy had this land beene, if theire prayers and vowes had been performed. Foralbeit ≈øome papi≈øts then did acknow<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ledge the Queenes; authority, notwith≈øtanding the popes excommunications; yet that was, for that the excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion did not bind them vntill ≈øuch tyme, as the Popes bulle might be put in exequntion, as appeareth by the faculties granted to <hi>Par≈øons</hi> and <hi>Campian.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Fourthly</hi> out of <hi>England</hi> they runne into Ireland to tell vs of the fidelity of <hi>Iri≈øh</hi> papi≈øts. But it appeareth tho≈øe men ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer came there to trye it. they ≈øhew ≈øo greate ignorance of the <hi>Iri≈øh,</hi> and of the affaires of <hi>Ireland.</hi> For in the battaile at <hi>Kiu≈øale</hi> they cannot name 10.

<pb n="120" facs="tcp:177776:65"/>At other times the mo≈øt part alwayes abandoned and betrayed tho≈øe that relied vpon them, and euer for one Iri≈øh man, that truly ≈øerued the Quene, there might bee recke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned 10. that willingly ≈øerued the rebells, And this ≈øhould the king finde at theire hands, J feare, if he had occa≈øion to trie them If then the≈øe petitioners haue no better argumentes to proue the fidelity of recu≈øants then ≈øuch as the≈øe, they will not proue <hi>refined gold,</hi> nor good copper, but rather Corke guilt ouer like gold, or ≈øome ≈øuch other light and ≈ølight ≈øtuffe good for nothing.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fiftly</hi> they tell his maie≈øty of the affection and behauiour of papi≈øts toward his predece≈ø≈øors, him≈øelfe and his title, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther forgetting King Henry the 7. nor King <hi>Edward</hi> the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fe≈ø≈øor.

Par≈øons and Coluill</hi> direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly oppugned the Kings title, in books in print, and to that boke, which <hi>Par≈øons</hi> ≈øet out as is ≈øaide, in diuers languages, the Iebu≈øitical faction yeelded a greate applau≈øe. Many of them al≈øo as the ≈øeculer pree≈øtes charged them, ≈øub≈øcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed vnto it.</p>
                  <p>Jf then nowe they pretend to fauour the kinges title, it is becau≈øe it were bootele≈ø≈øe and dangerous now to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugne it. likewi≈øe the papi≈øtes, that heeretofore wrote and ≈øpake in defence of his Maie≈øties Mother, and of the Kinges title, re≈øpected nothing el≈øe, but theire owne particuler, thinking by theire glo≈øing wordes, either to bring in Pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,

                  <p>But here they ≈øhoulde rather alledge cau≈øe to moue the King to tru≈øt them, then to ≈øhew, that they may a≈ø≈øuredlie tru≈øt the Kings mercy, who≈øe Clemency is ≈øo exceeding, and word ≈øo a≈ø≈øured.

The trea≈øon fir≈øt of <hi>Wat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øon,</hi> and <hi>Clerke,</hi> and lately of <hi>Garnet, Hall, Hamond</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers that con≈øorted with <hi>Percy</hi> and his complices doth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon≈øtrate this to be true.

                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly</hi> they require <hi>≈øome quiet, graue, and vertuous cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy men for the comfort of their ≈øouls.</hi> But this is ≈øpoken again≈øt the pol≈øhorne Pre≈øtes of Antichri≈øt. For they are not quiet, but turbulent and ≈øeditious, they are not graue, but light &amp; giddy headed, ready to runne vp the gallowes for the Popes ≈øeruice. They are not vertuous, but ba≈øe, filthy and leche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous fellowes. and this is proued by diuers particulers. Final<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the confort of Chri≈øtian mens ≈øoules confi≈øteth not in facul<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ties, indulgences, popi≈øh ab≈øolutions and ≈øuch antichri≈øtian tra≈øh as they bring, but in <hi>Christs</hi> ≈øweete promi≈øes, and in apo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>≈øtolike doctrine, and comfortable wordes of true preachers

                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly</hi> they tel vs, what fauours were doon to Queen <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryes</hi> Pree≈øts,, and other lay men affected to popery, e≈øpecially in the beginning of Queen <hi>Elizabeths</hi> reign.

But if they haue once the ≈øword in their hands, they ≈øatiffy the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> ≈øelues with nothing but the death and de≈øtruction of ≈øuch, as profe≈ø≈øe the truth.

For they were made pree≈øts at home, the≈øe by forreine ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myes. they acknowledged the princes ≈øupreme authority, the≈øe defend the authority of the Pope. They depe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>ded on the princes grace &amp; fauor: the≈øe depe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>d on the popes grace, &amp; withal their forces defe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>d his authority they offe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>ded of igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>ce notknowing the truth, the≈øe of malice ru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>ning out of their countrie, and oppugning a truth once known. They profe≈ø≈øed a playne kind of popery, and were not factiou≈øly di≈øpo≈øed. the≈øe are factious compagnions, and profe≈ø≈øe a more de≈øperate kinde of doctrine newly forged in the conue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>ticle of <hi>Trent. Finally</hi> they acknowledged the Queens mercy: the≈øe bark at her being dead, &amp; neuer cea≈øed to work again≈øt her being aliue. For proofe of the <hi>conformity of their petition to rea≈øon,</hi> they adde in the fourth place, <hi>that no religion did or cold euer con≈øi≈øt without preestes and pa≈øtors.</hi> But what is that to the≈øe pree≈øts of Baal, that at no true Prce≈øts ≈øucceeding the Apo≈øt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les in teching &amp; admini≈øtring ≈øacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>ts according to chri≈øts in≈øtitution, but idolatrous ≈øacrificers ordeined by Antichri≈øt
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:177776:74"/>to offer for quick &amp; ded? again what is that to the≈øe murdrers bloud≈øuckers, that are no pa≈øtors, but rather gunpowder trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, ≈øheepbiters, and de≈øtroyers of Chri≈øt his flock? La≈øtly if they ≈øeek for true pa≈øtors indeede, why do they for≈øake the bi≈øhops and pree≈øts of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> which indeed haue both the calling,, and exequute the function of true Bi≈øhops and pa≈øtors, and runne after the≈øe wolues, murdrers and deuourers of Chri≈øt's ≈øheepe?</p>
                  <p>Fiftly they offer <hi>to an≈øwere per≈øon for per≈øon, and life for life for</hi> the fidelity of theire pree≈øts to his maie≈øty, <hi>and the state.</hi> But what if the pree≈øts ab≈øolue traitors, and per≈øwade them to rebellion? where ≈øhall the ≈øtate ≈øeecke either for the parties or ≈øureties? And what ≈øhall it auaile to ≈øue the bonds? Agayne what a ridiculous conceite is this to thinke that the bonds of euery two or three ba≈øe compagnions will be ≈øuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to ≈øecure either the life of ≈øo greate a king, or the peace and ≈øtate of ≈øo greate a kingdome again≈øt men alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy found perfidious? Thirdly it will be a que≈øtion, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther if ≈øuch a matter were to be performed, euery pild crow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned pree≈øt could procure ≈øuch ho≈øtages and bondes as are offered. it may be ≈øome good old Ladyes and recu≈øant Cuckowes would offer any bond for their darlinges. But the wi≈øer ≈øort, J thinke, woulde neuer put their liues in ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard vpon the ma≈ø≈øepree≈øts promi≈øes, who if the pope com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand them to doe an exployt for their holy mother the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of fornications, regard neither promi≈øe, nor oath.</p>
                  <p>Finally it may be a que≈øtion, whether any ≈øuch bonds are good in lawe, and perca≈øe the≈øe good fellowes knowing them to be nought, are the bolder to offer them, thinking to gull the worlde with theire greate offers.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fiftly</hi> comming to the poynt of their pretended ≈øub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi≈ø≈øion they playnely refu≈øe to ≈øubmitte them≈øelues offring rather articles of a capitulation betwixt the King and them, then any forme of true ≈øubiection or ≈øubmi≈ø≈øion, for fir≈øte they ≈øay, <hi>they will acknowledge his maiesty to bee their lawfull King and ≈øouerein Lord, and will defend his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iesties
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:177776:75"/>heires and ≈øucce≈ø≈øors righte.</hi> And for this his maie≈øty is much beholding to them. But we mu≈øt vnder≈øtand, howe this offer is made vpon condition, if they may haue theire ma≈ø≈øe and theire Ma≈ø≈øe pree≈øts. if they may not haue theire reque≈øts, then they neither ≈øubmit them≈øelues, nor offer any thing. Further they acknowledge more then by the doct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine of popery they can make good. For by the chapter <hi>v. nam ≈øanctam. extr. de maior. &amp; obed.</hi> all kings are declared to be ≈øubiect to the pope. They do al≈øo deny the kings autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity in Eccle≈øia≈øticall cau≈øes, and offer many preiudices to the Kings righte, both ouer the Clergy and others, and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge him no further to be their lawfull king, then it ≈øhall plea≈øe the Pope, who hath power to excommunicate him and depo≈øe him, as they ≈øay. <hi>La≈øtly</hi> where they ≈øpeake of the Kings ≈øucce≈ø≈øors right, they forget to mention the kings righte. But what ≈øhould wee ≈øtand vpon future coniectures, when the trea≈øons of Wat≈øon, Clerk, Garnet, Hamond and the re≈øt haue plainely declared them to bee the kinges ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myes?</p>
                  <p>Secondly they promi≈øe <hi>to reueale, and to theire powers to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtand and preuent any con≈øpiracy, or trea≈øon agayn≈øt the King and his heires, and to defend the realm again≈øt forrein inua≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</hi> But mi≈øerable were the King and ≈øtate, if they ≈øhold de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend vpon their reuelations, and with≈øtandings of trea≈øona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble attempts and inva≈øions, that are ≈øworne to the pope &amp; depend vpon forrein enemies. Former practi≈øes and expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience ≈øheweth, that their words and promi≈øes are but ≈ønares to catch ≈øuch as tru≈øt them, of late they ≈ømothered the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øon of Percy and Cate≈øby as much as they could, &amp; ≈øoughte by all meanes to haue their country ≈øet on a flame. They ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge to his maie≈øty, <hi>what is due by the word of god, or hath been v≈øed</hi> by any of their ≈øect. but of the word of god they make the Pope ≈øupreme iudge, and v≈øe to deny obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to Kings excommunicate by him, nay to Kings not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicate, in eccle≈øia≈øticall cau≈øes, what they meane to performe it appeareth by Wat≈øons and Percies trea≈øons.</p>
                  <pb n="143" facs="tcp:177776:75"/>
                  <p> 
                     <hi>Lastly</hi> they ≈øay they will performe this, by <hi>prote≈øtati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or oath,</hi> and offer the like for their pree≈øtes. But what are oathes and promi≈øes, when they ≈øay the pope can di≈øpen≈øe with oathes, and teach that faith is not to bee performed to hereticks, in which rank the≈øe ≈øuper≈øtitious mini≈øters of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichri≈øte place all true Chri≈øtians? Furthermore it may bee doubted whether the≈øe felllowes can bring the ≈øtiffe necked ma≈ø≈øepree≈øts to take the≈øe oaths. if they ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>, yet ≈øhal they neuer make them to keepe them. doth it not then appeare, that the≈øe conning fellowes goe about to en≈ønare playne dealing men with their fal≈øe othes and feigned prote≈øtations? the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples of <hi>Iohn Hu≈ø≈øe,</hi> &amp; of the profe≈ø≈øors of religion in <hi>Fra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>ce</hi> and <hi>Flanders,</hi> that haue bene often ma≈ø≈øacred, when they rely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed vpon the othes and promi≈øes of the Popes adherents doe a≈ø≈øure vs of it, and Garnets trea≈øons may bee a caueat for vs. Wherefor ≈øeeing the≈øe proud ≈øuppliants confe≈ø≈øe them≈øelues but halfe ≈øubiects. and are much le≈ø≈øe then halfe when the pope commandeth them, who≈øe they are body and ≈øoule, &amp; ≈øeeing they always cut away halfe the kings authority, and ≈øometymes all, and endeuoure to bring vpon his maie≈øtye and his ≈øubiects, not only a fal≈øe, idolatrous, hereticall and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious religion, but al≈øo a mo≈øt greeuous yoke of the popes ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannicall gouernement, from which this land hath by the grace of god, and prowe≈ø≈øe of his maie≈øtyes noble ance≈øters been mo≈øt happily freed and deliuered, and ≈øeeing they haue alledged nothing, which might eyther iu≈øtify their abu≈øiue &amp; fal≈øe religion, or cleare them≈øelues from the common impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations of the di≈øloyalty of the popes adherents, or a≈ø≈øure the king and ≈øtate again≈øt the trecherous plots and practi≈øes of rinegued Engli≈øh ≈øacrificers, Iebu≈øites, and other theire a≈ø≈øo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciates euer ≈øu≈øpected, &amp; now lately plainely detected in Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies trea≈øo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> to be ≈øworn ≈ølaues of Antichri≈øt, &amp; profe≈ø≈øed ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myes to the king: I doubt not but his maie≈øty &amp; the ≈øtate wil take a cours with the≈øe bold &amp; importune petitioners, &amp; a≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øure the church and realme both again≈øt their corruptions in

                  <p>Finally they call them ≈øelues <hi>his maie≈øties true and loyall ≈øubiects.</hi> But how true, it appeared fir≈øt in the practi≈øes of Clerke and Wat≈øon, hanged at <hi>Winchester</hi> not lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>g ≈øence, and next in the attempt of Percy and his complices, diuers of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> being ab≈øolued and re≈øolued by ma≈ø≈øepree≈øts in their wicked purpo≈øes, and generally in the doctrine of ma≈ø≈øepree≈øts a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain≈øt the authority of Kings before mentioned, and in their combinations and intelligences with the pope &amp; other tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors and forreine enemies, as <hi>Par≈øons,</hi> and the popi≈øh cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals and ≈øuch like.
