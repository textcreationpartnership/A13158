            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE laſt Seſſion of the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, my good Lorde, I anſwered a certain petition then diuulged and printed by the Maſters and tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers of Popiſh religion: and this, I had well hoped, would haue ſatiſfied their diſciples and folowers, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their learned leaders ſo ſilent and vnable to replie. But I perceiue that the common ſaying now prooueth true, <hi>That many ſchol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers</hi>
               <note n="a" place="margin">Cicer. Epiſt. famil lib. <hi>9.</hi> ad varronem.</note> 
               <hi>paſſe their Maſters.</hi> For if they had not excelled their teachers in immodeſty, they woulde not haue rubbed ouer that ruſtie ſtuffe, which their betters are aſhamed to bring againe vpon the ſtage: and if they had not paſſed them in boldneſſe and importunitie, they would haue forborne to importune his Maieſtie and the ſtate further, in matters formerlie, for ſuch graue and important conſiderations, moſt worthilie reiected. And yet I ſpeake not this, to the intent to clear their maſters. For beſide that this ſeemeth a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſe
<pb facs="tcp:177776:3"/>of their Maſters the Maſſeprieſtes and Iebuſites, that make others to ſolicite their forelorne cauſe, <hi>Chryſoſtom homil.</hi> 43. <hi>op. imperf. in Math.</hi> telleth vs, <hi>that the impiety of the ſchollers is to be imputed to the maſters.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The argument of both petitions is one in effecte, and therefore much more needeth not to be ſaid now then that which is formerly aunſwered to the Maſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prieſts. Yet becauſe all haue not ſeene the former pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition and anſwer, nor vnderſtood their gunpowder, and rebellious practiſes; and theſe Lay, or rather lame Romane Catholikes, ſeeme to ſtand more vpon their loyaltie, then the other; I thought it not amiſſe, after this late diſcouery of their moſt horrible treaſons, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulerly to examine this diſcourſe alſo, and with mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginall Gloſſes to poynt to the fooleries of their text, which notwithſtanding I would not haue all ſimple pa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>piſts take, as ſpoken to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues. for my meaning was to touch only theſe Petitioners, and ſuch as ſubſcribe this factious Petition.</p>
            <p>Much adoe we haue about toleration of popiſh re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, but we may ſay, as <hi>Saluianus</hi> lib. 7. <hi>de prouidentia</hi> ſaid ſometime in another caſe: <hi>vtinam hoc remedium ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lorum, &amp; non diuturna toleratio.</hi> I would this toleration, which they deſire, were a remedie of their pretended euills, and not rather a long continued toleration of miſchiefes, and that both in the Church and ſtate. For why, I beſeech you, may we not ſo ſay, ſeeing no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can be granted, that is either more derogatorie to Gods honor, or more preiudiciall to the Kings ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſty and ſtate, as hath in part appeared by this late at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, and as God willing it ſhall at large, with moſte
<pb facs="tcp:177776:3"/>inuincible arguments, be demonſtrated?</p>
            <p>This my diſcourſe, moſt reuerend Father, I preſent to your Honor, as a pledg of my loue, and an acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment of your Lordſhips fauours towards me: and the rather, that both your Lordſhip and al true Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians truelie zealous for the cauſe of true pietie, and ſtudious of the ſafety of their countrie, may thereby vnderſtand, how much it importeth them all to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur in repreſſing ſuch notorious inſolency, &amp; factious courſes. Theſe men, they are like the heretiks, of whom <hi>Irenaeus lib.</hi> 5. <hi>aduerſ: haereſ.</hi> ſpeaketh, <hi>which being blind in matters of truth, did contradict their own ſaluation. Caecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entes circa veritatem,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>ſuae contradicunt ſaluti.</hi> But pious governours will neither neglect the ſafety of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion &amp; the ſtate, nor of theſe conte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tious gaineſayers of truth, if they doo not wilfully ſhut their eares to the truth, and their eies to the light, and careleſly neglecte the reſtraint of the vnderminers both of the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment houſe, and whole State. Wherefore referring theſe matters next to Gods prouide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, to the zealous care of our ſuperiors, I commend this worke and my ſelfe to your Lordſhip, and your Lordſhips proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous eſtate, to the fauour of the almighty.

                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>
               </hi> DOE not beleeue, gentle reader, that many lay papists will ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe this petition, albeit pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to bee framed and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited by all of them to the King. It were a matter too ſawcy, for wiſe, and ciuill men to challenge the king of breach of pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>miſe, as they do pag. <hi>8:</hi> and too preſumptuous to rayle on religion publiquelie profeſſed, and the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors thereof, to the Kings face, as they do in diuers places. Neither do I think, that all are ſo foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh, as to make themſelues pledges and hoſtages for their Maſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prieſts, ſuffering ſuch ſlippery co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>panio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s to dominere in their houſes, to confer with their wiues &amp; daughters, to waſt their eſtate, while they haue no Counterbond from them, either for the others good behauiour, or theire owne ſecuritie. This I am well aſſured, that what ſoeuer is pretended, this petition neuer came Originally from the heades of lay papiſtes. For neyther may ſuch men withoute licence, reade <hi>Caluines</hi> Inſtitutions, nor <hi>Luthers</hi> bookes, nor o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther diſcourſes written by men of our ſide: nor may they take vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them to diſcourſe of Religion, as the Authors of this petition doe.</p>
            <p>I wold therfore pray the ſimpler ſort of plain meaning Papiſts, not to take what ſoeuer is ſharpely ſpoken againſt the Maſſe Prieſtes maſked vnder the name of lay papiſts, and the ſole deuiſers of this
<pb facs="tcp:177776:4"/>petition, and their abherents, the Authors of many treaſons and miſchiefes, as ſpoken or meant againſt themſelues, and all ſedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced ſimple ſoules. And againſt ſuch as ſo violently run a courſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt truth, and ſeek to blow vp the King and State: I doubte not, but all indifferent men will eſteeme my ſpeech moderate, and this kinde of dealing most fitting and conuenient. What? ſhall vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>circumcized Philiſtims raile at the people of God, and ſeeke our destruction; and ſhall not true Chriſtians be permitted liberty to repreſſe theire inſolency, to countermine their vndermining trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, and freely to defend the truth?</p>
            <p>When themſelues do publiſh their petitions, they may not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe to haue them publiquelie examined; and no reaſon haue they to complaine of wrong, ſeeing themſelues thus handled, when not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding their wicked intentions, they put forth their Apolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyes, requeſts, and diſcourſes into other mens handes, as if they were moſt loyall and honeſt men.</p>
            <p>Hitherto they haue abuſed the worlde with a falſe pretence of antiquitie, and falſelie chalenged to themſelues the name and ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle of <hi>Catholiques.</hi> They doe alſo before ſuch, as are ignorant of matters of ſtate, ſtand vpon termes of loyalty, and loue of theire Prince and country. But now that we are ſo farre vrged, we ſhall God willing, make it appeare, that their Popiſh deuiſes are nothing but a pack of nouelties latelie brought into the Romiſh church, &amp; that their Religion is full of hereſies, impieties and blaſphemies: and laſtly that diuers of their practiſes are full of Salt peter, and moſt dangerous to the ſtate: and that their importunate deſires are repugna<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t both to reaſons of religion &amp; ſtate, and alſo to modest and ciuill cariage.</p>
            <p>My ſole requeſt to thee ſhall be, that thou woldeſt be pleaſe to com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pare our anſwer with the lay papiſts petition, and to iudge accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to proofes, We ſeeke for trueth, we defend the Kings preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue and ſtate. Let no man therfore ſhut his eies againſt that light, by which we may ſee truth, nor bee careleſſe in matters ſo nerelye touching the ſafety of the King and ſtate, neither let any papiſt bee offended with vs, while we ſeeke his ſaluation. <hi>Non ideo vobis diſpliceamus,</hi> ſaith Saint Auguſtine <hi>to certein Donatiſts, epiſt.
<pb facs="tcp:177776:5"/>204. ad Donatum, quia reuocamus erra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes, &amp; quaerimus perdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tos.</hi> and ſo wee ſay alſo to the ſimple, and abuſed papiſts, <hi>Let vs not diſpleaſe you, becauſe we ſeek to call you from your errors, and to gaine that which is loſt,</hi> We doe not hate you, as our Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimen, but we deteſt your errors, being humorouſly affected to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raine ſuperſtition. In ſpeaking alſo for common peace and ſafety we ſeek your peace. The petitioners ſay, they are reſolued and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend reaſon of their reſolution. But nothing is more fantaſtical or fooliſh, then to reſolue vpon falſe ſuppoſitions, and to build with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out firme foundation. neither is any thing more ſottiſh then to ſeek that, which being granted, would turne to theire diſhonoure and hurt, if not destruction.</p>
            <p>To confirme the weake, and to recall thoſe which goe aſtray wee haue done our best endeuour: wee haue alſo defended the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor of religion, his maiestie, and the state, as became vs. The reſt wee referre to gods grace; beſeeching him, ſo to enlighten all chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian mens heartes with the knowledg of his eternall truth, that not onelie the profeſſors of religion may stand firm againſt the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing perſwaſions of ſeducing and ſeditions Iebuſites and Maſſe-Prieſts: but alſo ſuch, as encline too much to error and ſuperſtiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and nowe ſeeme malcontented, maye be gathered into the true Church, and ſhew themſelues true ſubiects, embracing truth and perſeuering therein to their liues end.</p>

               <head>Chapter <hi>1.</hi> The reſolution of the petition apologeticall of the Lay papiſts, together with a ſomme of the anſwer, made vnto it.</head>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">C</seg>Ommonly we ſee by experience, that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſes going before accuſations, doo argue a ſecret confeſſion of the faultes of guiltie conſciences. Jf nothing els did ſhew it; yet this, and diuers other petitions, and Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logies directed by diuers Maſſe prieſts, and Papiſts vnto his royall maieſtie, who nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther chargeth them, nor proceedeth againſte them for thoſe matters, which they goe about to couer and excuſe, do prooue it ſufficiently. For what reaſon haue they to make ſo many de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenſes and excuſes, if they did not knowe in their conſciences, that there are certaine matters, wherewith they deſerue to bee charged? doo the defendants vſe to make their anſwers before the accuſers exhibit their bills, or articles?</p>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:177776:6"/>
               <p> But ſuppoſe their conſciences were cleare: yet their wordes do argue plainly, that neither for their faith towards god, nor for their fidelity to his maieſtie, they ſtand vpright in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon reputation of their countrimen. For if they did, what ſhould they need to publiſh ſuch Apologies, wherein they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend <hi>to giue his Maieſtie an accompt of their beleefe and religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and a full and ample ſecuritie and ſatisfaction of their fidelities and ſubmiſſion?</hi> againe, if their cauſe were ſo cleere, why doo not Maſſeprieſts come foorth, and ſhew themſelues? and why ſhould the lay Papiſts be ſo ſparing in giuing the King his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogatiue, and ſo lauiſh in aſcribing his right to the Pope? Laſtly what meant <hi>Percie</hi> and his companions, to attempt ſo bloodie an execution, and all papites to pray for the good ſucceſſe of matters deſigned? To forbeare to ſpeake of the quality of their cauſe, which we ſhall haue more occaſion to do hereafter, firſt we are to vnderſtand, what their intention is, in this their Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logeticall Epiſtle, and next what forme they keepe in their proceedings. Their requeſt is firſt, that penall lawes made heretofore againſt Maſſeprieſtes, recuſantes, and their abettors, may be either reuerſed or ſuſpended. And next, that Popiſh religion and the teachers thereof, may be tolerated vpon a certaine forme of ſubmiſſion. And laſtly, that his maieſty wold be pleaſed to accompt Papiſts for his good ſubiects, and to ſuſpect the reſt. Matters all of verye hard diſgeſtion, and verie difficult to be proued, or granted.</p>
               <p>Yet what dare they not attempt, to obtaine a toleration of their wicked abuſes? firſt they threaten the King, Chapter 3: with an intimation of their numbers, forces and intelligen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces bothe at home and abroade: not forgetting to bragge of their qualities and merites. Next they alleadge certaine reaſons of their reſolution in popiſhe religion. Thirdly, which to vs ſeemeth very admirable, conſidering their manifold rebellions and treaſons againſt their princes &amp; cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries both in <hi>England</hi> and elſewhere, and the late horrible trea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſon then in brewing, they ſtand vpon high termes of theire loyall carriage and fidelity. Fourthly, albeit the ſame be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:177776:6"/>the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>paſſe of their apologeticall petition, yet they run out into a long accuſation of the profeſſors of true religion, therein inuoluing his maieſty &amp; the gouernors of the ſtate, &amp; as it were ridiculouſly making them to anſwer, that muſt be their iudges. <hi>Lastly</hi> they offer a form of ſubmiſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; prete<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d to giue vs ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ent ſecurity for the Kings life, &amp; for the preſeruation of the ſtate of which the firſt declareth their obedience to be very bare &amp; onelie voluntarie, the ſecond argueth theire pride to bee in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſupportable, which vndertake to capitulate with the King, and thinke their worde and bonde ſufficiente for the ſecuritie of ſuch a king and ſtate. But wee muſt vnderſtand, that nowe they were conceiting theire horrible treaſons, and that they ment to burne their bonds, and the parties to whom they ſtood obliged, This is the ſubſtance of their pleading. For the better garniſhing whereof they propoſe reaſons, firſte of their former ſilence, &amp; next of the breach of their ſilence in this petitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> apologeticall: albeit we haue iuſt cauſe to wonder, how they can well ſpeak of ſilence, when ſo many of their conſorts, haue neuer ceaſed their babling and ſcribling about this obiect &amp; how they dare prete<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d reaſons of this petitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that is ſo deuoid of weight, reaſon, &amp; wiſedom, Beſide theſe reaſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s <hi>Iohn Lecey</hi> commeth in, with a prologue in commendation of the act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours in this Pageant and certaine baniſhed Maſſe-Preſtes ſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d in the rereward with an epilogue to the Lords of his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſties cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſel, accuſing them of iniuſtice &amp; hard dealing, which ſome confeſſe in part to bee true. for if they had been iuſtlye dealt with all; then had they been exequuted for their treche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous practiſes, and felonies, for which diuers of them ſtood by lawe condemned, and not ſent awaye to rayle vpon ſuch, as ſhewed mercie and fauoure to them. And this is the corps, the deua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, derrier, &amp; al the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts of this lame petitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> apologeti<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cal, framed, as is ſayd, by lay Papiſts, or rather in theire names by certein maſſe-Prieſts.

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE Church and city of God, beeing built vpon the foundations of the Apoſtles and Prophets, and their doctrine: it is matter ſufficient for Chriſtians, that are members of Gods church, and citiſens of the citie of god, to refuſe and reiect any Religion, if the ſame be not founded vpon holy ſcriptures, nor taught by the Apoſtles and Prophets inſpired by gods ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit. But if the ſame proue not onely diuers and ſtrange, but alſo contrary to apoſtolical and propheticall doctrine, and conteine not only falſe and hereticall opinions, but alſo poſitions and fancies tending to idolatrie, and plaine impietie; then oughte all Chriſtians to abhor and flie from ſuch a wicked religion, and by no meanes to tolerate thoſe, that either teach it; or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe it, or fauor it.</p>
               <p>The law of god, <hi>Deuteronom.</hi> 13. is very direct and peremp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory againſt falſe teachers and ſeducers, that endeauour to drawe men to idolatry, or any falſe religion whatſoeuer. <hi>That prophet</hi> ſaith Moyſes, <hi>or that dreamer of dreames ſhall bee ſlaine becauſe he hath ſpoken to turne you away from the Lord your god.</hi> In this caſe hee doth not permit either the brother to fauour

               <p>The Prophet <hi>Dauid Pſal.</hi> 16. ſheweth, what deteſtation all the children of god ought to haue, not onely of idolatrie, but alſo of all idolaters and falſe worſhippers. <hi>Their offerings of blood ſaith he, wil I not offer, neither make mention of their names with my lips.</hi>

               <p>The ſcriptures alſo teache vs, that as god proſpered their endeuours, which with ſeruent zeale ſought to remooue all monuments and reliques of idolatry: ſo nothing ſucceeded to thoſe, that ſhewed themſelues either fauourers of falſe reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, or negligent and cold in maintaining the purity of his ſeruice. The angel of the lord <hi>Iudges</hi> 2, threatned the Jſraelits, that they ſhoulde not preuaile, becauſe they had made a league with the Cananites: and doe we thinke, that contractes made with ſeditious hereticks can be either ſucceſſefull, or of long continuance?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Salomons</hi> ſeate was eſtabliſhed ſo long, as hee ſoughte the lord with his whole hart: but giuing him ſelfe to women, and ſuffering by their meanes idolatrous worſhippes to creepe into his kingdom, his glorye began to decline, and his troubles to encreaſe.</p>

                  <hi>Aſah</hi> proſpered ſo long, as he put away the Sodomites, and his fathers idols. but when he ſought to the Aſſyrians for help, gods help and fauour began to faile him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Hezekiah</hi> was highly fauorued of god, becauſe he tooke away the high places, and brake downe the images. and <hi>Ioſiah,</hi> as hee was greatly loued of god, ſo was he much commended by men for that he put away the idoles, and killed the idolatrous prieſts that were the maintainers of falſe Religion.</p>
               <p>Contrarywiſe, <hi>Ierobvam, Rehoboam, Abiah, Amaziah, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſſeh,</hi>

               <p>Jt is a dangerous thing to fauour ſuch, as deuide themſelues from gods Church, &amp; to company with idolaters, and impious perions. Hardly ſhal a man touch pitch, &amp; not be defiled.

Joſuah Chapter</hi> 23. threatneth the <hi>Iſraelites:</hi> if they ſhall cleaue vnto the nations, and make mariages with them, that <hi>they ſhall be a ſnare and destruction vnto them, and a whippe on theire ſides, and thornes in theire eyes.</hi> Such are the ſcandales, that ariſe of tolerating and conſorting with wicked compag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions. <hi>Jehoſophat</hi> hardly eſcaped with his life ioyning in ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cietye, and giuing aide to the wicked King <hi>Ahab,</hi> and was ſharpelie reprooued for it.</p>
               <p>The 2. <hi>Corinthians.</hi> 6. teacheth Chriſtians not to company with idolaters or profane perſons: <hi>what communion</hi> ſaith he, <hi>hath lighte with darkneſſe? and what concorde hath Chriſt with Belial? and what part hath the beleeuer with the infidell? and what agreemente hath the temple of god with idoles?</hi>

               <head>Chapter <hi>4.</hi> That to admitte the exerciſe of falſe religions formerlie forbidden, is contrary both to chriſtian policie, and reaſon.</head>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE gentils by the light of reaſon perceiued, that religion was not lightly to be changed and god dooth therein taxe his people by his prophet, that they were more eaſily indu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ced to change the euerliuing god, then the Heathen nations were to cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge their gods. They co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſidered, that ther was but one truth, &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſtantly beleeued, that their religion was true. This was the reaſon why the <hi>Romanes</hi> did ſo viole<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly perſecute the primitiue chriſtians, and refuſed the ſuperſtitious rites of <hi>Bacchanalia,</hi> which priuilie began to creepe in among the people.</p>
               <p>But Chriſtians proceede vpon better groundes of policie in prohibiting the exerciſe of all falſe religions. For firſte they conſider, that the wrath of god is reueiled from heauen againſt ſuch, <hi>as with-holde the truth in vnrighteouſnes.</hi> But who doe herein offend more greeuouſly then they, which either grant liberty to falſe teachers, or winke at the exerciſes of a wicked and falſe Religion? doe not they manifeſtly giue way to errors and ſtop the courſe of truth?</p>
               <p>Secondly they know, well that god <hi>deſpiſeth thoſe, which deſpiſe him,</hi> as we reade, 1. <hi>Samuel.</hi> 2. and that hee caſteth ſuch out of his fauour, as are neither hote nor colde. Jf then ſuch as regard not to ſee god rightly ſerued, reſt deſpiſed, and luke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warme profeſſors are reiected: how will it goe with ſuch, as are
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:177776:11"/>colde in ſetting forth true Religion, and care not what falſe doctrines are ſtirring abroade in the world?</p>
               <p>Thirdly they vnderſtand the greeuous threatnings of the law againſt all idolatrous &amp; falſe worſhip of god. I <hi>am a iealous god</hi> ſaith the Lord, <hi>and will viſit the ſinne of the Fathers vpon the Children to the third and fourth generation of thoſe, that hate me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fourthly as there is but one god, ſo they know, that there is but one true religion. Chriſtian policie therefore may teach them to admit no religion, but that, which is founded vpon the writings of the Apoſtles and Prophets, and which they are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolued is moſt true.</p>
               <p>Fiftly diuerſities of religions breed diſtractions of mens minds and diuers ſeditious ſtirres, and tumultes, as the leagues of <hi>France,</hi> and practiſes of the popes agentes in <hi>France, Flan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, England, Scotland, Germany</hi> and other countries doe declare. of late the Papiſts ſeeking to replant their ſuperſtition in Engla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, went about to ſet the land on a flame, and to drown true religion in blood. But wiſe politicks are by all means to roote out theſe ſeedes of Ciuil diſſenſion.</p>
               <p>Sixtly all changes in matters of ſtate are dangerous. But ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitte a falſe and erroneous religion, where nothing but the true faith hath been profeſſed. &amp; then no doubt but the cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge will be great.</p>
               <p>Finally nothing is more abſurd, then to change lawes with out cauſe, and to admitte a religion condemned by lawes, and to reſtore ſuch as are condemned by the ſtate. For that is rather a ſubuerſion, then an alteration both of lawes and ſtate. If then we reſpected nothing but the danger of ſtate in the mutation of religion; yet woulde all pollitick and wiſe men bee well aduiſed howe they admitted a newe and falſe religion contrary to that which hath formerly beene receiued by the ſtate.</p>

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Might, if J liſt, enlarge the former diſcourſe, with diuers other reaſons againſt toleration of diuers religions. but what ſhould further demonſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons neede to proue that, which no papiſt will, as I thinke, deny? let vs therefore ſhewe, becauſe theſe apologeticall petitioners ſtand much vpon the trueth and honeſty of their religion, that beſide the former generall rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, there are diuers other particular matters to be obiected againſt popiſh religion, euery one ſufficient to croſſe their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires. For firſt it is a falſe and erroneous religion. Next the ſame is ſuperſtitious and idolatrous. Thirdly it is, compoſed of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers hereticall poſitions. Fourthly it is a pack of nouelties. Fift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie it conteyneth diuers doctrines full of Blaſphemies. Sixtly it is enemie to kings, and greeuous to their ſubiects. Laſtly it co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teyneth many pointes of doctrine condemned by the aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaryes themſelues: and alloweth diuers practiſes diſliked by all nations.</p>
               <p>That Popery is a religion falſe and erroneous, we prooue firſte by the falſhood of the groundes thereof, and next by the erroneous poſitions and doctrines, whereof it is compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed. Stapleton in his book entitled, <hi>principia doctrinalia,</hi> doth deliuer vnto vs. 7. grounds or principles of popiſh religion. The firſt is <hi>the church of Rome,</hi> the ſecond is <hi>The Pope.</hi> the third <hi>the meanes vſed by the Pope in iudgement,</hi> the 4. the <hi>Popes infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble indgement in cauſes of controuerſy.</hi> the fiſt his <hi>power in tax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or conſiguing the canon of holy ſcriptures.</hi> the ſixt his <hi>certain interpretation, when he expoundeth ſcriptures.</hi> the ſeauenth the <hi>churches or popes power, in deliuering doctrine not written.</hi> The which grounds, as they are defectiue, not me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tioning the cano<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of ſcripturs, as a ground of fayth, nor reputing the decrees of councels, and writings of Fathers to be any matter of mome<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t deſeruing to be placed among the principles of our aduerſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries fayth: ſo they are moſt abſurde and falſe. For <hi>firſt</hi> howe
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:177776:13"/>can the church of Rome be a principle or foundation to it ſelf? and againe why ſhoulde the Church of Rome, where Peter taught be more a foundation or principle, then the Churche of <hi>Hieruſalem,</hi> where our ſauiour <hi>Chriſt</hi> himſelfe taughte and ſuffered? the apoſtle <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. doth threaten the <hi>Romanes,</hi> and ſignifie that the <hi>Roman</hi> church was a branch, that mighte bee cut of. And <hi>Saint John Appocalypſ.</hi> 17. ſheweth, that the whore of <hi>Babilon,</hi> which was a figure of Antichriſt, ſhould haue her ſeate in <hi>Rome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly the Popes doctrine is notoriouſly declared to be er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roneous, and that in many materiall pointes, as for example in the queſtions aboute the lawe, the ſacramentes, tranſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiation, the gouernement of the Church, and diuers other important points. But were it not a matter already knowne and reſolued; that the Pope cannot be ſupreme iudge in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of religion; yet the papiſts haue no reaſon to thinke, that a blind man can iudge of colors, or an ignorant man of Artes. Furthermore the pope hath no greater priuiledge, then the high prieſt of the law, Yet he erred in condemning <hi>Christ</hi> and his doctrine. <hi>Lastly</hi> both the fathers ſhew, that diuers biſhops of <hi>Rome</hi> haue bene Herreticks, as <hi>Liberius and Honorius:</hi> and <hi>Adrian the.</hi> 6. in his booke <hi>de ſacrament. c. de confirmat.</hi> co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>feſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth, that <hi>the pope may determine falſelie by his decretall.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly</hi> it is ridiculous to truſt to the popes meanes in iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, when he vnderſtandeth neither councels, nor vſeth any good meanes to know the truth. Nay wee knowe, whatſoeuer means are pretended, that the pope either ru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>neth vpon his own head, or followeth a few carnall cardinals, or contentious friars.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly</hi> it is a blockiſh thing, to diſtinguiſh the Pope from his iudgement. For ſo the pope ſhould be found to be without iudgement, &amp; iudgme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t without the pope. That this iudgmente is not infallible, we gather infallibly out of his manifold erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous doctrine &amp; iudgme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t. The ſame appeareth alſo by his falſe decretalls, and the variation of the popes iudgement.</p>
               <p>Fiftly the ſcriptures being conſigned by god, and deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to the church by the prophets and Apoſtles, need no new
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:177776:14"/>conſignation, nor taxation of the pope. Nay very abſurd it were, if lawes receiuing their ſtrength from the gouernors, the ſcriptures ſhold not be authenticall without the approbation of the pope, who for the moſte part vnderſtandeth no ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, nor hath ſkill to reade them in theire originall tongs.</p>
               <p>Sixtly the Pope is for the moſte parte ignorante both of the ſence of ſcriptures, &amp; of the principal poynts of religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing ſtudied neither. And very ridiculous it is, after plain words of ſcriptures, and expoſition of counſels and fathers, to runne to the pope for reſolution.</p>
               <p>Finally the reſolution of matters of fayth dependeth not vpon the determination of the pope, or his adherentes, who are departed from the fayth, but vpon the word of god, that in matters of ſaluation is plaine, and better expounded by the learned, and by auncient fathers, then by partiall Popes and their adherentes. <hi>Stapletones</hi> groundes therfore are falſe and erroneous. Neither are the principles deliuered by others more certaine.</p>
               <p>The conuenticle of <hi>Trent ſeſſ.</hi> 4. dooth ſeeme to found the faith of the Church partly vpon ſcriptures, and partly vpon vnwritten traditions. But <hi>firſt</hi> the ſame alloweth no ſcriptures authenticall, but ſuch as are found in the old latine of the bible which in many pointes digreſſeth from the originall bookes, and is much inferiour vnto them.</p>
               <p>Secondly they allow no interpretations of ſcriptures, but ſuch as are conſonante to the doctrine of the church of Rome. which in matters of controuerſy are moſt peruerſe, erroneous and abſurd, as may appeare by diuers particulers <hi>in the ſuruey of popery.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly they make the bookes of <hi>Tobiah, Iudith, Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eus, Wiſedome and Machabies,</hi> together with certaine frag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments not found in the original books of the old teſtame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, equal to other ſcriptures alwaies reputed canonicall; the which is reproued by the common conſent of auncient fathers, and ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth repugnant to reaſon.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly</hi> vnder coloure of traditions they thruſt vpon the
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:177776:14"/>Church, not onelie diuers Fables, and ſuperſtitious toyes, but alſo a greate part of the errors of the church of <hi>Rome. Finally</hi> they talke of Apoſtolicall and Eccleſiaſtical traditions, and yet can not certainely deriue them, eyther from the Apoſtles, or from the Ancient catholike Church. Theſe foundations, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore are ruinous, and rather ſerue to prooue the erroncous do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of <hi>Antichriſt,</hi> then the faith of <hi>Christe Ieſus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Canus</hi> in his booke <hi>de locis theolog.</hi> among his principall groundes and proofes of chriſtian religion, reckoneth, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the acts of Councels and writings of the fathers, but alſo the authority of ſchoolemen and canoniſts of profane writers, and of humane reaſon, yea of the popes, and moderne church of <hi>Rome.</hi> Now what I beſeech you, is more vncertaine, then to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vpon the vncertaine actes of councels, and connterfact wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings ſet out vnder the name of fathers?</p>
               <p>Againe what is is more vnreaſonable, then to bring forth the pope &amp; his complices for witneſſes or iudges in their owne cauſe? Lex dei ſaith <hi>Athanaſius, Apolog</hi> 2. <hi>inimicum, ne que teſte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ne que iudicem eſſe vult. the lawe of God admitteth not our ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to bee either iudges or witneſſes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Finally</hi> naturall reaſon is blind in the cauſe of true religion. &amp; profane men write profanely. Theſe groundes therfore, as they are faultie, cannot ſerue for immoueable groundes of the chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian fayth.</p>
               <p>Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monly all papiſts doe build their faith, not ſo much vpon ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie ſcriptures, as vpon vnwritten traditions, popiſh decretals, ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing miracles, feyned viſions, &amp; the Romiſh churches Practiſe. But theire miracles and reuelations haue for the moſte parte no better authoritie, then from the forged and lying legendes of ſaintes. the falſhhood of their Decretalls and traditions is declared by the writings of auncient fathers. the practiſe of the moderne Church, is contrary to the apoſtolike and catholike church of old time. For in that Church we neither finde any vniuerſal pope with triple crown &amp; guard of Swizzars, nor any Romiſh maſſe, nor popiſh indulgences or purgatory, or ſuch like traſh.</p>
               <pb n="20" facs="tcp:177776:15"/>
               <p> Vpon theſe falſe and erroneous grounds it is no maruell, if they haue framed to themſelues a moſt falſe and erroneous religion, as may appeare by theſe particulars. Concerning ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tures they teache, that they are no perfect canon of our fayth. and <hi>next</hi> that they are not authenticall to vs, vnleſſe they be conſigned and deliuered to vs by the Pope, and his adherents. <hi>Thirdly</hi> they ſay that the Latin tranſlation is authenticall, which they doo not affirme of the originall books. <hi>Fourthly</hi> they ſay, they are obſcure and hurtfull.</p>
               <p>Laſtlie they permit them not to bee read publikely in tongues vnderſtood of the multitude. But the Apoſtle 2. <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. ſayth, <hi>They are able to make the man of God perfite,</hi> and none but here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tikes, as we may read in <hi>Ireneus,</hi> euer accuſed them of inſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency. Secondly as lawes, ſo ſcriptures haue receiued theyr ſtrength from the author of them, that is from the holy ghoſt. And thoſe are very abſurd, that do beleeue the Pope ſpeaking in his decretalls, and will not beleeue God ſpeaking in holy ſcriptures. Thirdly all the fathers prefer the originall books of ſcripture before the tranſlations. Fourthly the word of god in ſcriptures, is called light, and the food of the ſoule. Who then that is not led by the ſpirit of Satan, can repute them obſcure or hurtfull? Laſtly neuer was it taught or hearde in auncient times, that ſcriptures were publikely red in tongues not vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood.</p>
               <p>Secondly they giue to Chriſt in the ſacrament a body, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther felt nor ſeen, nor any way like to our bodies. For what man J beſeech you, euer had a body, that was in many places at once, and yet filleth no place? they holde alſo that being in his mothers womb, he was <hi>vir perfectus,</hi> that is a grown man; and that, <hi>as man, he was omniſcient and knew all things.</hi> His of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of mediatorſhip they communicate vnto the virgin <hi>Marie</hi> and other ſaints, and to Angells, and ſomtime ſtick not to call ſaints <hi>their redeemers,</hi> as <hi>Bellarmine</hi> in his firſt book <hi>de iudul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gentijs</hi> confeſſeth. To make a treaſure of indulgences they mix the merits of Chriſt and his ſaints together, as if Chriſts merits were inſufficient. Their Maſſeprieſts, as they ſay, are after the
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:177776:15"/>order of <hi>Melchiſedech.</hi> Finally, they make them mediators for Chriſts body, as theſe words of the Maſſe declare, <hi>ſuſcipe hanc oblationem &amp;c.</hi> and again, <hi>ſupra quae propitio &amp; ſereno vultu reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picere digneris.</hi> That is, <hi>receiue this oblation,</hi> viz. of Chriſts body and blood. And again, <hi>Looke vpon it with a fanourable and ſerene countenance,</hi> Of which doctrines no one is true, and diuers are blaſphemous and impious.</p>
               <p>Thirdly they ſay, the Pope is ſaint <hi>Peters</hi> ſucceſſour, and Chriſts Vicar, albeit he neither teach the goſpell, nor admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter the Sacraments, nor reſemble them almoſt in any thing. Him alſo they make the heade ſpouſe and foundation of the vniuerſall church, albeit he can ſhew graunte for none of theſe prerogatiues. They teach further, that he is aboue general coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels, and hath power to depoſe kings, and that his lawes bind mens conſciences. but ſuch doctrines are not only erroneous but alſo abſurd.</p>
               <p>Fourthly they caſt out of the catholike church all, that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe not their faith, although elect to life, and contrarywiſe, make reprobate perſons, hereticks, and wiched men profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the Romiſh faith, and communicating with the Romiſhe church true members of chriſts body: they hold alſo that the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike church is alwayes ſo viſible, that euery man may ſee it and diſcerne it. Finally they ſhut the catholike church within the limits of the Romiſh church. Matters repugnaunte to holy ſcriptures, and no way agreeing with the nature of the true, ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike and apoſtolike church, nor very well with reaſon.</p>
               <p>Fiftly moſt falſly they teache, that the Pope onely hath power to confirme generall councells, and that no man els ought to ſummon them, and praeſide in them. They hold alſo, that the conuenticles of <hi>Laterane, Conſtance, Florence</hi> and <hi>Trent,</hi> are comparable to the fowre firſte generall coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cells.</p>
               <p>Sixtly they make their followers belieue, that the moderne church of Rome differeth not from the aunciente Romane Church, and that the ſame is guided by gods ſpirit, and cannot erre. But their erroneous doctrine different from that which <hi>S.
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:177776:16"/>Paul</hi> taught the Romans declareth the contrary.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Commonly they take to themſelues the name of Catholikes yet their doctrine of the maſſe, of their half communions, ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the ſacrament, merites of congruity and condig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, of Popiſh indulgences, worſhippe of images, and ſuch like was neuer receiued of the Chriſtians of all times and pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</p>
               <p n="8">8. <hi>Parſons</hi> in his booke of 3. <hi>conuerſions,</hi> giueth out, <hi>that Saint Peter and Eleutherus</hi> did teache the moderne Romane faith, to the aunciente Britones, and <hi>Auſten</hi> the monke to aunciente Saxons. But hee faileth in his proofes, and with a harde and bare face telleth nothinge, but bare and improbable lies.</p>
               <p n="9">9. They teache their followers to worſhip ſaintes, and to ſay Maſſes in their honour, and to go on pilgrimage, and to offer to them, and confirme the ſame with falſe and counterfet tales of Saint <hi>George, Chriſtina, Catherin, Margaret, Dorothey,</hi> and ſuch like legendes; confirming falſe doctrines with falſe tales.</p>
               <p n="10">10. Their doctrine of 7. Sacraments is moſt falſe. For no where can they ſhew where Chriſt inſtituted eyther the form or mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of all theſe ſacraments, or promiſed grace and iuſtification to all theſe ſacraments.</p>
               <p n="11">11. Falſely and diſhonorably they teache, that brute beaſts ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the ſacrament, eat alſo Chriſts body.</p>
               <p n="12">12. Chriſt ſayd <hi>take and eat,</hi> they ſay to their prieſts in effect, <hi>lift and offer,</hi> and to the people, gape and gaze.</p>
               <p n="13">13. They teach their folowers to make grauen images, and to worſhip them. yet god in his law expreſly forbad the worſhipp of them.</p>
               <p n="14">14. God commaunded his people to ſweare by his name. they teach their diſciples to ſweare by Saints and other crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</p>
               <p n="15">15. Falſely they teache ſubiects to rebell againſt theyr Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces excommunicate by the Pope, and that the Pope hath power to aſſoile them from their allegeance, a doctrine falſe and ſedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious.</p>
               <p n="16">
                  <pb n="23" facs="tcp:177776:16"/> 16. They teach, <hi>that concupiſcence in the regeneras, is no ſin,</hi> and that the virgin <hi>Mary</hi> was not conceiued in ſinne. Which holy ſcriptures condemne as crroneous.</p>
               <p n="17">17. The ſtate of perfection they place in the vowes of monkes and friers, as if their rules conteined more perfection, then the goſpell.</p>
               <p n="18">18. Their iuſtification they place partly in charity, partly in their own works, and hope thereby to merit heauen. but the law pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nounceth them accurſed, that abide not in all the words of the law to do them.</p>
               <p n="19">19. Charity, they ſay, is the forme of faith; and nothing els but the grace of God. But this vtterly deſtroyeth grace.</p>
               <p n="20">20. They doubte not, but that they are able to ſatisfy for all ſins committed after baptiſme. but true chriſtians beleeue, that by Chriſts ſtripes they are healed.</p>
               <p>Finally all thoſe doctrines, which the papiſts teach contrary to the faith of the church of <hi>England,</hi> are falſe and erroneous: as is demonſtrated in diuers ample treatiſes publiſhed againſte them.</p>

But of this crime we doubte not, but plainelie, to conuince them.

               <p n="2">2 <hi>Secondly</hi> the papiſts confeſſe, that <hi>Latria.</hi> or the honour properly due to god is due alſo to the croſſe, and crucifix, and images of the trinity. This is the doctrine of <hi>Thomas Aquuinas,</hi> and all his folowers. But it leaueth theſe idolaters without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe. For how can they defend their doctrine, vnleſſe they wil deny theſe croſſes, crucifixes and images to be creatures? 3 <hi>Thirdly</hi> they make vowes to ſaints &amp; angels, and in their pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like liturgies call vpon the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.

               <p n="4">4 <hi>Fourthly</hi> they make an idol of the Pope, giuing vnto him the honoures and titles, that are properly due vnto Chriſt, and making him <hi>the head ſpouſe,</hi> and <hi>foundation</hi> of the catholike Church: In the chapter <hi>ſatis diſt.</hi> 96.

<pb n="25" facs="tcp:177776:17"/>before him, and worſhippe him, as god. Nowe what is idolatry elſe, but to aduance a creature aboue his rank, and to giue him diuine titles and honors?</p>
               <p n="5">5. Fiftly it is idolatry to make grauen images, and to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip them. For that is apparant by the wordes of the ſecond commandement, that is ſpecially directed againſte idolatry. But the papiſts make grauen images and worſhip them. Nay they worſhip them no otherwiſe, then the gentiles did theire idoles. Both gentiles and papiſts praye before them, both offer incenſe vnto them, both doe thinke to honoure the memory of the deade in erecting images to them, why then ſhold not this be reputed idolatry, as wel in the papiſts, as in the gentiles? verily if we do rightly eſteem of matters, we ſhal find, that papiſts do more ſlauiſhly ſerue their idols, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the He then did their idoles, going in pilgrimage to them, kiſſing them &amp; crouching vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and ſetting vp lights before them.</p>
               <p n="6">6. They make the images of god the father, &amp; god the holy ghoſt &amp; of the trinity, &amp; giue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> diuine honor. But to worſhip falſe images as theſe are, the papiſts themſelues confeſſe to be idolatrous. Jt is manifeſt idolatry alſo to giue gods honor or <hi>latria</hi> to creatures.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Euery day of the week the papiſts make new gods of the al<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tar, &amp; ofte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they make new crucifixes. The Pope alſo canoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zeth at his pleaſure new ſaints.

But what can vain prete<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces auaile, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we ſee they communicat gods honuor to theſe creatures?</p>
               <p n="8">8. The holy ſcriptures <hi>Amos</hi> 5. and <hi>act.</hi> 7. condomn the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for idolaters, <hi>that worſhipped and ſerued the hoaſt of heauen.</hi> But papiſts worſhip angels &amp; ſaints, &amp; the court &amp; hoaſt of heue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>; &amp; ſerue them religiouſly. Nay they are ſo farre from acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging their errour herein, that they contend, that <hi>dulia,</hi> or <hi>ſeruice</hi> is due vnto them.</p>
               <p n="9">9 The gentiles are condemned as idolaters <hi>pſal.</hi> 114. for <hi>that they worſhipped images of ſiluer and gold, and the worke of

               <p n="10">10 The apoſtle 1, <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. ſaith the gentiles <hi>offred ſacrifices to deuils,</hi> and the reaſon is, for that they offred them in honoure of men, and without warrante, tranſlating gods honoure to creatures. are not the papiſtes then aſhamed of their maſſes, that are no better, then ſacrifices to deuils being offered in honoure of men, and to the diſhonoure of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and <hi>chriſtian</hi> Religion?</p>

               <p>For firſt the Pope challengeth to himſelfe the name and honour of God, as is euident by the chap. <hi>ſatis. diſt.</hi> 96. and <hi>c. inter corporalia. de tranſlat. pral.</hi> and the Canoniſts giue vnto him that name and honour, as is to be ſeene in the gloſſe <hi>in c. cum inter. extr.

               <head>Chap. <hi>11.</hi> That toleration of popery, is contrary to reaſons of ſtate.</head>
               <p>FVrthermore with ſmall labor it may be ſhewed, that popery is a religion full of contradictions, abſurdities and foole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:177776:25"/>and ſo contrary to holy ſcriptures, and the catholike faith of <hi>christians,</hi> as darkneſſe to lighte. falſehood to truth, and black to white. But this ſhort anſwere will not admitte any ſuch large diſcourſe. beſide that all theſe poyntes are at large prooued in <hi>the ſuruey of popery,</hi> publiſhed in anſwere to <hi>Kelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons</hi> inuectiue <hi>Suruey.</hi> Now therefore it ſhall bee ſufficient to ſhew, that as popery is contrary to the rules of Chriſtian reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, ſo it si no leſſe repugnant to reaſons of ſtate, and deroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory both to the Authority of Kinges, and to the libertie of Chriſtians.</p>
               <p>That popiſh religion is contrary to reaſons of ſtate and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liticke gouerne ment, it apeareth <hi>firſte,</hi> for that the ſame is ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrous, wicked, falſe, and contrary to gods true ſeruice. nowe what ſtate can long continue, that either receiueth ſuch a wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked religion, or elſe is careleſſe for the eſtabliſhment of gods ſeruice? <hi>Them that honoure me</hi> ſaith the Lord. 1. <hi>Samuel.</hi> 2. <hi>I will honor, and they that deſpiſe me ſhall bee deſpiſed.</hi> The Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle alſo Rom. 1. ſheweth, <hi>that the wrath of god is reueiled fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> heauen againſt all vngodlines and vnrighteouſneſſe of men, which withold the truth in vnrighteouſneſſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly</hi> it is alwaies dangerous to change lawes, and to reuerſe matters heretofore orderly paſſed. But if popiſh religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on were tolerated, then ſhoulde all thoſe lawes ceaſe, that concerne the articles of religion, the book of common pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, the forme of adminiſtration of ſacramentes, the kinges roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all authority in eccleſiaſticall cauſes, the miniſters of gods worde and ſacramentes, and the poſteſſions of the church. Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally many things now well ordered, would then bee called in queſtion. if then lawes be the bands, that conteine the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon welth in order, who ſeeth not, that a greate diſlolution of ſtate woulde followe if Popiſh religion were tolerated?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly</hi> the pope claimeth power to diſpoſe of kingdomes, and to depoſe kings. and all his true diſciples doe maintain his Claime. Js it then poſſible, that any ſtate ſhould ether liue vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſuch a tyranny, or tolerate ſuch profeſſed enemies of ſtate?</p>
               <pb n="42" facs="tcp:177776:26"/>
               <p> 
                  <hi>Fourthly</hi> the ſame man pretendeth right to giue lawes to the ſtate eſpecially in eccleſiaſticall cauſes, and to diſpoſe of the liuings of the church, But I thinke noe ſtate will giue this power to ſtraungers, and enemies, that hath liberty to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fiftly</hi> we reade. that pope Paule the third in his bulle of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication againſt King <hi>Henry the eighte,</hi> King of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nd,</hi> commanded his ſubiects to take armes againſte him, gaue away his true ſubiects as ſlaues to thoſe that coulde take them, diſſolued all bondes, wherein any ſtood bound to him or his ſubiects, as is euidently aparent in the words of his bulle recorded in <hi>Sanders de ſchiſmate,</hi> &amp; the collector of his <hi>Bulles.</hi> and this authority all pops claime, and al papiſts muſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend. But it is ſtrange, that any ſtate ſhould endure ſuch indigni<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ties offered to princes and theire ſubiects.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sixtly</hi> no man can ſerue the pope and his prince and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trye, eſpecially beeing in oppoſition with the pope. howe then can the ſtate admit ſuch as depend vpon the pope, and are ready to exequute his commandementes and take them ſelues bound to do it vpon paiue of damnation? Nay Percie and other papiſts of late without his commaundement as they ſay, were in a fayre way to ouerthrow the ſtate.</p>
               <p n="7">7. <hi>To reſtore baniſhed men, to acquite condemned perſons, &amp; to let priſoners looſe, that are in cuſtody by order of law, is the moſte extreme condition that loſt common wealths may be drawn vnto,</hi> as <hi>Tully</hi> ſaith <hi>lib.</hi> 5. <hi>in Verrem. perditae ciuitates</hi> ſaith he, <hi>deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratis omnibus rebus hos ſolent exitus exitiales habere, vt dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nati in integrum reſtituantur, vinctiſoluantur, exules redusa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tur.</hi> But toleration of popery doth bring all theſe incommodities with it. ſhold we then baſely ſubiect our ſelues to enemies, and traitoures, &amp; take that courſe, which no ſtate euer yeelded vnto, vnleſſethe ſame were brought to extreme and deſperate termes?</p>
               <p n="8">8. No ſtate can admitte ſuch as depend vpon forreine ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myes and intertaine intelligence with them. For that were to imbrace within our boſomes the enemies of ſtate. But that is
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:177776:26"/>the caſe of the archpreeſt, of the Iebuſites, Maſſepreeſts, gun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pouder traytors and all their adherents.</p>
               <p n="9">9. No ſtate can be well gouerned by two gouernors, and two diuers lawes. For as there is but one principall gouernemente In a ſtate, ſo ought there to be but one authority, and one law. but if papiſts bee tolerated, then the pope muſt aſwell be obeyed as the king, and the popes laws be ioyned with the kings lawes. furthermore the common wealthe will prooue a monſter, not onelie with two heades, but alſo with two ſoules and two diuers kindes of proceedings.</p>
               <p n="10">10. The bonds of ſtate are lawes, &amp; the bonds, that tye ſubiects to their princes, are othes of allegeance, and loyall affection towardes them. But papiſts being diſpenſed with all by the pope reſpect neither lawes of ſtate, nor othes of allegeance, nor loue due to princes. Howe then can any ſtate tolerate ſuch fellowes, as reſpect nether bonds of ſtate, nor duty, nor obligation toward their lawfull princes?</p>
               <p n="11">11. Lawes puniſh ſuch as contriue the murther of priuate perſons, and much more ſuch, as are ready vpon euery occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, to ſtirre ſedition. ſhould then then the ſtate tolerate ſuch, as vpon the Popes commandement, and warrant, nay vpon the word of a ſeditious Maſſeprieſt, ſhall thinke it lawfull &amp; me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritorious to murther &amp; empoyſon any, that ſhalbe oppoſite to theyr factio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, or that ſhal be ready to exequute any miſchieuous enterpriſe againſt the ſtate? the papiſtes wil deny themſelues to be in this caſe. But what ſhould any man truſt denials, that remembreth Percies and Cateſbyes and Garnets late trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons?</p>
               <p n="12">12. If we beleeue not rules of ſtate, yet let vs conſider in what daunger ſtates ſtand, that haue in theyr bowels many Iebuſites, Maſſeprieſts, and their complices, ready to execute the popes will, by examples and precedents of former times. And firſt let vs remember how many enterpriſes were made by them in the late Queenes dayes of famous and bleſſed memory, to bring their country vnder the commaund of ſtrangers. Next, what attemptes they made againſt that innocent princes life.
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:177776:27"/>Thirdly, what libells they ſet out to the diſgrace of the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall gouernors of the ſtate. Fourthly let vs conſider, what ſtirrs and rebellions they rayſed in the dayes of King <hi>Henry the</hi> 8. <hi>King Edward,</hi> and <hi>Queene Elizabeth.</hi> Fiftly it may not be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten, how they made a league in <hi>France</hi> againſt the king, and cruelly murdered King <hi>Henry</hi> the third, and empoyſoned di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers, that ſtood in their way. Sixtly the maſſacres of <hi>Fraunce,</hi> and cruell executions in <hi>Flanders</hi> ſhew, what they wil do here, if once they thinke themſelues ſtrong enough. Seuenthly. if we forget all the reſt, yet may we not forget <hi>Percies</hi> late treaſon, who in the ruines of the Parliament houſe, meant to bury both King and ſtate, and to maſſacre all Chriſtians, oppoſite to the popiſh faction. Laſtly, if of nature papiſts were quiet; yet will the Pope neuer ſuffer them to reſt, vntill he haue his will.</p>
               <p>Our laſt reaſon of ſtate againſt Popery is, for that the ſame is both enemy to princes, and moſt grecuous to chriſtian ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects; which remayneth now in particular chapters to bee handled.</p>

<pb n="45" facs="tcp:177776:27"/>ſet forward. And ſecondly, that want of occaſion and meanes hath rather hindered their violent and furious courſes, then any change or alteration of their former reſolution in oppugning their oppoſites.</p>
               <p>But ſuppoſe his maieſty and the ſtate were not of a contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry religion to the pope; yet it ſhall be prooued, that popery is aduerſe to Kings, that like well inough of that religion. For firſt all kings liuing vnder the popes obedience, are the popes ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects. <hi>Boniface the</hi> 8. declareth it in the chapter <hi>vnam ſanctam. ext. de maior &amp; obed.</hi> where he ſaith, <hi>it is neceſſary to ſalnation for all men to be ſubiect to the Pope.</hi> Now what greater indigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, then to make kings the popes vaſſalls and ſubiects?</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>Bellarmine lib.</hi> 5. <hi>de pontif. Rom. c.</hi> 6. ſayth, <hi>that the pope hath power to take away kingdomes from ſome, and to bestow them on others.</hi> The ſame doctrine is alſo maintained by <hi>Robert Parſons</hi> in his ſeditious book of titles. He doth alſo traiterouſly affirme, <hi>that the people may ſometime lawfully proceede against princes. VVilliam Roſſe</hi> in his book <hi>de iuſtareip ſupra reges im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pios &amp; haereticos authorit. c.</hi> 2. affirmeth impudently, <hi>that the right of all the kings and kingdomes of Europe, is layde vpon this foundation, that the ſtate or people may depoſe their kinges.</hi> But grant this; and then are kings tenants at the popes, and peoples will. For what is more eaſy, then to impute grieuous crimes to princes, if the pope or ſeditious mutins lift to quartell with them?</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>Bellarmine lib.</hi> 5. <hi>de pontif. Rom. c.</hi> 6. determineth, <hi>that it is not lawfull for Christians to tolerate a king, that is an infidell, or an heretike, if he go about to draw his ſubiects to his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.</hi> The papiſts therefore, as we ſee, are taught to make it a matter of conſcie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, to depoſe their kings, and the maſſeprieſts ſet them on to rebellion. <hi>Pius the fift,</hi> excommunicated all ſuch as would not take armes againſt Queen <hi>Elizabeth.</hi> and <hi>Clerke</hi> and <hi>VVatſon</hi> firſt, and lately <hi>Percie</hi> and <hi>Cateſbie,</hi> and theyr complices attempted the Kings deſtruction, albeit, they ſay, he is not declared excommunicated. Nay admit a Prince were not aduerſe to the pope in religion; yet if the Pope pretend any
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:177776:28"/>matter of quarrell vnto him, his ſubiects are ſtirred againſt him and hee is excommunicated, as may appeare in the Duke of <hi>Ferraraes</hi> caſe, excommunicated by <hi>Clement the</hi> 8. becauſe he wold not deliuer vp into the popes hands, his dukedome of <hi>Ferrara.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fourthly, ſuppoſe a king keepe good correſpondence with the Pope; yet he is not within his kingdome, as papiſts teache, to make eccleſiaſticall lawes. nor may refuſe to obey the popes eccleſiaſticall lawes. But he is no ſoueraign king, that eyther receiueth lawes of other, or hath no power to make lawes for his ſubiects in matters of externall Church gouernement.</p>

               <p>Furthermore, as Chriſt was greeued to ſee the houſe of god made a denne of theues, ſo it cannot chuſe but greeue his diſciples, to ſee the houſe of god poſſeſſed by <hi>Antichrist,</hi> and al true teachers chaſed away, oppreſſed, and murdred in places, where his complices can preuaile. there alſo ſcriptures in to<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gs vnderſtood of the multitude are ſuppreſſed, and the Popes heſts followed more diligently, then the lawes of God.</p>

               <p>The multitude of the popes lawes, &amp; the burthen thereof lyeth heauy—vpon their conſciences, for their friars teach them, that they binde the conſcience.</p>

               <p>The taxes impoſed both vpon the clergy and laity are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny and greeuous. No act of religion almoſt is done without paying. of theſe payments the pope rayſeth great trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures.</p>

We haue iuſtified our charge in diuers treatiſes both in latin and Engliſh, and yet they anſwere nothing particulerly.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly</hi> litle ſhew of reaſon haue they to deſire his maieſty to admitte a religion, which depriueth him of halfe his autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, halfe his ſubiects, halfe his reuenewes, and maketh him ſubiect to the pope.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly</hi> they doe without all reaſon demand the free exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of a religion, that bringeth mens conſciences into thral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome. their perſons into danger, and their landes and goods into the hands of tyrantes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly</hi> the pope and maſſeprieſtes make merchandiſe of mens ſoules, and make little conſcience to buy and ſell chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, altars, dignityes, heauen, grace and all ſpirituall thinges. They ſpoyle the poore, the widdowe and fatherleſſe, and for maynteinaunce of their owne eſtates, make hauocke of Chriſtian mens eſtates. Haue they then reaſon, to ſue for ſuch a bargayning and ſpoyling religion?</p>
               <p n="5">5. They ſhew the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues deuoid of reaſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that admit maſſe prieſts into theire houſes, that like owles fly the light and ſight of the magiſtrate, that intertaine intelligence with forreign ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, that deuoure theire ſubſtance, that like impure lechours abuſe the wiues, daughters, and maides of ſuch, as giue them intertainement, and pretending to make them <hi>Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like</hi> doe indeed make them <hi>Cuckoldlike.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Sixtly we finde by proofe, that Maſſe-preeſts and <hi>Jebuſites</hi> haue combined the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues with foreign enemies, &amp; haue ſought the deſtruction of the ire ſouereigne princes, &amp; the thraldome of their natiue country to ſtrangers. Jf any man doubted of this before, the horrible treaſon and rebellion of Percy, Catesby &amp;
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:177776:31"/>their followers, and their wicked deſeignements may reſolue him. And therfore if reaſon may rule them, none of the kings true ſubiects can ſeek the aduancement of this treache rous religion.</p>
               <p>Finally papiſts haue no reaſon to aſke that of vs in England, which themſelues deny to vs and our brethren in <hi>Spaine</hi> and <hi>Italie.</hi> There they will not ceaſe their butcherly proceedings, nor put downe their houſes of Inquiſition. Neither will they be induced to ſuſpend their penall lawes made againſt true Chriſtians. What face and forehead then haue papiſts, to aske that in England of vs, which they will not yeeld to vs and our brethren in other countries? is it not reaſon, that they ſhould doo to others, as they would haue others to do to themſelues? and doth not the law <hi>quod quiſque ff. quod quiſque iuris.</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain great reaſon, determining, <hi>that euery man ſhould be iudged according to the law, which himſelfe vſeth?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But if papiſts wil needs, vrge things vnreaſonable, then muſt they vnderſtand, that true Chriſtians haue reaſon to reiect their treacherous, falſe, erroneous, new, abſurd, ido latrous and blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemous religion.</p>
               <p>And next, that his Maieſty hath iuſt cauſe to abhor the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe of that religion, that (as hath bin foreſhewed) maketh him the Popes vaſſall, and taketh away halfe his authority, halfe his ſubiects, halfe his reuenues, and bringeth the reſt into queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Now his Maieſty is in no daunger by the grace of God. if he can ſuppreſſe the growing faction of Antichriſt. <hi>Sixtus Quintus</hi> in his declaratory Bull, anno. D. 1588. againſt our late gratious Queen confeſſeth, <hi>that hee had no meanes</hi> to proceede againſt her, as he had in countries profeſſing popery, to deale with other princes. But let Maſſeprieſts gather their bands of ſeditious perſons together and then both prince, and ſtate ſhal incur great hazard.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, the preachers of the Catholike faith haue good occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to oppoſe themſelues againſt theſe wolues, that ſeeke to enter vpon Chriſts flock. They ſeek to alter both religion and ſtate, and will not reſt before they haue depriued al true paſtors
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:177776:31"/>both of their liuings and life. will not then true pnſtors awake and vigorouſly reſiſt them?</p>
               <p>Fourthly, Wiſe politikes may not admit a religion, that will cauſe diniſion, and trouble the peace of the ſtate. Neither may they tolerate ſuch as depend on ſtrangers, and concurre with forain enimies.</p>
               <p n="5">5. The diſciples of Chriſt may haue no felowſhipp eyther with the prieſts of <hi>Baal,</hi> or the caniball Maſſeprieſts, that ſay they eat Chriſts fleſh with their mouths and teeth, &amp; ſwallow his blud into their bellies, or with the diſciples of Antichriſt, that ſeeke to ſuppreſſe the true catholike faith.</p>
               <p n="6">6. No true louer of his country can endure rinegued <hi>Iebuſites</hi> and Maſſeprieſts, that are combined with forreign enemies, and ſeeke to bring their countrimen vnder the commaund of ſtraungers, and to murder all, that are ſtudious of the peace and honor of their nation, as <hi>Walleyes,</hi> and others Ieſuites actions of late haue plainly declared.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Charitable Chriſtians may not tolerate either a race of ſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy begging friars, or a packe of lazy Monkes, or a ſwarme of caniball Maſſeprieſtes, which ſay they eat vp Chriſts body really and corporally, but indeed and really deuour the poor, the widow and the fatherleſſe.</p>
               <p n="8">8. Men of honeſt minds and diſpoſition are enemies to all le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherous and fodomiticall Friars, Monks, and Maſſeprieſts. nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther will they ſalute them, heare them, or conuerſe with them, leaſt they be partakers of their ſinns, and conſequently of theyr plagues.</p>
               <p n="9">9. Chriſtians maintain their Chriſtian liberty, and haue reaſon to deteſt the doctrine of Antichriſt, that enthralleth both theyr perſons and conſciences. Further as it pilleth theyr goods, ſo it deſtroyeth vtterly the ſoules of them and theyrs.</p>
               <p>Finally, ſeeing they cut our brethrens throates abroade; no Chriſtian man hath reaſon to ſuffer them to harbour here, pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing to cut our throats at home. <hi>Faux, Percie,</hi> and <hi>Cateſbie,</hi> haue left a race of cutthrotes and gunpowder fellowes behind them. ſhold then reaſonable men ſo far forget reaſon, as to har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken

               <list>
                  <item>1. Firſt it is confeſſed by our aduerſaries themſelues, that no idolatrous religion is to be tolerated in any ſtate. But it is clear<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly demonſtrated, heretofore <hi>Chap.</hi> 7. that popiſh religion in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers pointes is idolatrous.</item>
                  <item>2. Neither will they yeeld to permit any ſects, or hereſies but it is apperant, that monks, friars and Maſſeprieſts are diuided into ſects. and manifeſtly haue we prooued <hi>Chap.</hi> 8. that popiſh religion is a maſſe of old, and new hereſies.</item>
                  <item>3. Further they confeſſe, that all impious and blaſphemous opinions are to be ſeuerely puniſhed, and neither by publike graunt to be authorized, nor by conniuence to be paſſed ouer. But hardly ſhall the papiſts be able to cleare themſelues of the impieties and blaſphemies, wherewith formerly they ſtand charged.</item>
                  <item>4. Fourthly that cannot be true religion, that containeth ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther falſhood, or foolery, or error. Nor do papiſts deny, that ſuch falſe religions are to be repreſſed, and by lawes extermi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated out of the commonwealth. But in our ſuruey of Popery we haue ſhewed, that diuers poſitions of popery are not onely
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:177776:32"/>erroneous, and falſe, but alſo fooliſh and ridiculous.</item>
                  <item>5. Kings that are ſubiect to the Pope will not ſuffer any religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, if they can chuſe, that is either preiudiciall to their dignity, or dangerous in reſpect of their ſafety. But many arguments &amp; examples do ſhew, that popiſh religion is of that nature, as for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly hath bin declared.</item>
                  <item>6. The Popes themſelues, albeit vſurpers, will not ſuffer any of their ſubiects to bind themſelues by oath to forreine princes in enmity with them, or to entertaine intelligence with them. Why then ſhould ſuch as are ſworn to the enimies of the ſtate, and entertain intelligence with them, and practiſe againſt the ſtate, be ſuffred in England?</item>
                  <item>7. In <hi>Italy</hi> no man is permitted to harbour any prieſt or friar, that denieth the Popes vſurped ſupremacy.

                     </p>
                     <p>Further, their title, and teſtimony is not more deſtitute of truth, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of reaſon. For neither is <hi>a petition,</hi> an <hi>apology,</hi> nor an <hi>apology</hi> a <hi>Petition,</hi> that they ſhould call their diſcouſe <hi>a peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion apologeticall.</hi> Nor had they reaſon to alleadge ſaint <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi> wordes concerning the good workes of Chrſtians, who
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:177776:35"/>notwithſtanding were reputed malefactors. For little doe they fit the cauſe of papiſts, whoſe good works are gheaſon and whoſe practiſes of treaſon and rebellion in ſo many re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordes doe conuince them to be truly malefactors. The ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar preeſtes alſo confeſſe, that the exequutions done vpon Maſſe-prieſtes and theire adherentes were iuſt, and neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.</p>
                     <p>The preface of <hi>John Lecey,</hi> or rather lazy Iohn, is nothing elſe but an idle declamation in prayſe of this pſeudapoſticall petition, and the authors thereof, wherein this ſcraping fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe endeuoureth to tickel the galled backs of his owne compagnions with his forged commendations. But let them beware they truſt him not to farre, leaſt he draw them with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the compaſſe of his own diſloyalty, and bring them where Percy and Cateſby left them.</p>
                     <p>The Lazy fellowe directeth his ſpeech to ſome odde &amp; nameleſſe ſacrificer. for hee calleth him <hi>reuerend Sirre.</hi> but if the Maſſelouers were not blinded with affection, they might thereby ſee howſoeuer this geare is thruſt forth vnder the name of <hi>lay papists,</hi> that all the aduantage proceeding therof, commeth to the polſhorne preeſts of <hi>Baal.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In the entrance of his matter he maketh greate bragges, telling his frend, <hi>that this petition, or apology</hi> (he knoweth not whether to call it) <hi>is ſo conformable to reaſon, ſo abſolute in forme of the petitioners ſubmiſſion, and ſo admirable for the aſſurance by them offered for theire preestes and pastorus, that the publiſhing thereof cannot but giue content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, in his opinion, to all ſorts of men.</hi> But his performance is nothing correſpondent to his greate countenance. For <hi>firſte</hi> we haue already ſhewed, that this requeſt for a toleration of popery is not only contrary to reaſon, but alſo to religion, &amp; all Chriſtian policy.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly</hi> the ſubmiſſion, that they make, is very defectiue co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſidering theire denyall of the Kings authority in Eccleſiaſt icall cauſes, and their de pendance vpon the Pope, that clai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth a ſuperiority ouer the king.

                     <p>
                        <hi>Thirdly</hi> theire admirable aſſurance is moſt admirably ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous: For who doth not wonder and laugh, to heare aſſura<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce offred for the life of ſo great a King, and ſo potent a ſtate, by a few thridbare fellowes, we know not, who they are? the parliament houſe had beene blowne vp, who ſhoulde haue ſued their bonds? who ſhould haue brought them into the Starchamber for periurye? Againe when the Pope ſo eaſily diſpenſeth with oathes and diſſolueth contracts, what rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon hath any Chriſtian to depend either vpon him, or his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herents. for either oth, promiſe or bond?</p>
                     <p>Beſides all this, our prologue, where hee thinketh himſelfe horribly eloquent, ſpeaketh playne contradictions, &amp; foole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries. For firſte if the petitioners had ſuch reaſon, as he preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth, what ſhould they neede to make a ſubmiſſion, as ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing committed ſome greate crime? againe what ſubmiſſion can a ſubiect make, to his ſouereine, that it is not required of him by duty? thirdly ſuch as make ſuch abſolute ſubmiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, as he talketh of, neede nor to put in bonds, or pledges. Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally it is foolery to thinke either that papiſts are true <hi>catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likes,</hi> or that ſuch, as ar truly informed of the continual practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of the <hi>fierye Iebuſites</hi> and maſſeprieſtes, agaynſte the ſtate, will like of their vnreaſonable requeſtes, and no man can take them to bee wiſe, that charge their iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges with praeiudice before hearing, but to ſay or ſignify, that nothing can ſatiſfie the ſtate, <hi>but the blood and vtter beggary of Catholikes.</hi> or rather papiſts, is plaine villany, and not to be proued againſte any gouernor of this ſtate, No, they deſire their reformation, and not their deſtruction or hinderance, and much it were to be wiſhed, that Percy and other papiſts had been no more malitiouſly affected to vs, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we to them. Alledging reaſons for the publiſhing of this treatiſe, he diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puteth like a wilde man, running far beyond his witte &amp; rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. firſte hee ſaieth that <hi>the publiſhing of this Apology cannot but tend much to his maieſties honor, and more to his ſatiſfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:177776:36"/>and ſecurity:</hi> as if thoſe did honoure him, that charge him with breach of promiſe, &amp; note him with the ſtain of hereſy &amp; hatred to catholike religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, as the petitioners do. Further what ſecurity and ſatiſfaction can thoſe yeelde his maieſty, that eſteeme neither othes nor bonds, when the pope con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremandeth them? but did they meane to keepe both; yet prinate mens bonds are no ſecurity for ſuch a king &amp; king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. They talke J confeſſe, of <hi>loue and deuotion</hi> to the king. But it appeared but little, by the practiſe of <hi>Brooke, Clerke, and VVatſon</hi> firſt, &amp; les lately by the treaſon of <hi>Percy, Cateſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bie</hi> and Faux, who of meer loue ſought to blow vp the king &amp; the whole parliament. to omit to ſpeake of their ſecret com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>binations and practiſes, it is no good ſigne, that they ſeeke to ſatiſfie the King, and to ſerue him deuoutly, when they ſeek to ſet vp a religion diſpleaſing to God, diſgracefull &amp; hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to the King, and moſt praeiudiciall to his ſubiects.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly</hi> He ſuppoſeth the Prelates of the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> cannot with reaſon diſallowe this petition, <hi>ſeeing no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is required at theire hands, but a reaſonable conference, and ſatiſfaction in poynts of their miſſion and vocation.</hi> But it ſeemeth he meaneth to giue them but little ſatiſfaction; that refuſeth to giue them theire due titles, and telleth them of, I know not what <hi>wealth, pleaſures and pallaces</hi> prete<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded to be enioyed by them. Hee is alſo very ignorant. that imagineth, that the teachers of the truecatholike faith, can abide a falſe wicked, idolatrous, hereticall, &amp; blaſphemous religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, or true ſubiects treaſon and rebellion, and very impudent to call true Biſhops in queſtion for theire vocation and miſſion, hauing no colour of defence eyther for the miſſion and vocation of Maſſe Prieſtes, to ſacrifice for quicke and deade, as for the Pope to rule the whole Church, or for the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinalls to practiſe the troubles of Chriſtendome. Further he was not wiſe to talke of <hi>Biſhops winess</hi> being allowed by <hi>ſainte Paule,</hi> ſeeing the periured <hi>Romiſh</hi> preiſtes forſwearing mariage and ſwearing continency, doe notwithſtanding keep concubines, whoors, and <hi>Bardaſſaes.</hi> As for the cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:177776:37"/>of our prelates, and miniſters, it hath been often and ſufficiently iuſtified already, and ſhal be againe, when the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſion of the pope, and his poleſhorne crewe, of ſacrificing preeeſts into the Church ſhal not by any means be maintei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, or coloured.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Thirdly</hi> he ſeemeth very carefull, not to offend <hi>the Puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanes,</hi> as he calleth them. But it is offence inough, to giue the names of faction to true Chriſtians. Furthermore, if the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts be no better able to pleade for themſelues and theire religion, then theſe petitioners haue done; not only ſuch, as they call <hi>Puritanes,</hi> but alſo all other good Chriſtians will condemne them to be neither half ſubiects, nor condicionall ſubiects, nor ſubiects at all. As for their religion it groweth euery day more odious and execrable then other.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Fourthly</hi> the ſchollers of <hi>Cambridge</hi> and <hi>Oxford</hi> of all men reſt worſt ſatiſfied with this petition, being voyd both of lear<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ning and reaſon. as for the conceipt which ignorant crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures haue of maſſe preeſts, they regard it not, knowing the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to be but ſhallowe fellowes in diuine matters, though very profound in rebellions and treacherous practiſes. miſerable are they, that followe ſuch guides, and truſt ſuch falſe fugi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue compagnions.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Fiftly</hi> the Artizans and prentizes of <hi>London</hi> would make a wiſer ſpeake, then this petition. ſo ſeely defences are therin made for the popiſh preeſts, that how ſo euer they thought on them before, they cannot chuſe now, but both cry out a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſte them and ſtoppe them, as falſe fugitiues, ſeditious traitours and profeſſed enemies to their prince and country. In the meane while the maſſe preeſts haue litle cauſe to tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>k <hi>Iohn Lazy,</hi> that maketh them pleade theire cauſe before arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zans and prentiſes, who generally deteſt them and theire ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hominable doctrine and practiſes, and hope to ſee the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly hold vp their hands at the barre for treaſon.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Finally</hi> the papiſts at home and abroad will be very ſory to ſee theire cauſe ſo nakedly handled, and ſo weakely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended; and, if they be wiſe, will curſe him, that publiſhed ſo
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:177776:37"/>bare a diſcourſe giuing vs occaſion to diſcouer theire trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherous, hereticall, and wicked doctrines, and other myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of the popiſh faction. As for the example of <hi>Saint Alba<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        </hi> and of his teacher, it fitteth the papiſts in no ſorte. Thoſe two knew no one poynte of that wicked doctrine of papiſts, which the Church of <hi>England</hi> condemneth, neither was <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bane</hi> martyred for the popes quarrell, or the doctrin now co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teined in the decretales, but for the faith and doctrine of <hi>Chriſt</hi> and his Apoſtles, being as loyall to his gouernors as the <hi>Jebuſites</hi> and their complices, are peruerſe and diſloyall. And therfore at vnawares, where the prologue wold vſe the example of the <hi>primitiue church of England,</hi> he printeth <hi>priuatiue church,</hi> ſhewing himſelfe to be a member rather of the popes priuatiue church of <hi>England,</hi> that is depriued &amp; woulde depriue Chriſtians of all true faith in veritie of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and ſincerity in conuerſation, then of the true primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue Church founded by <hi>Chriſte,</hi> and gouerned by the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtels and their true ſucceſſors.</p>
                     <p>But what ſhold J need to ſtand longer about the examinatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of this poor ſpeak of this rude &amp; Lazy prologue, who ſo far forgot himſelf in his dates of his diſcourſe, that he publiſheth in print the 16. of octobre, this apology, that as hee ſaith in the beginning of the prologue, came to his handes the 28. of that month. which if he be able to make good, then he hath ſent vs rather a propheſy, then a preface, telling vs what the lay papiſtes pleaded, ſome 12 daies before their pleading came to his handes,</p>

                     <p>The next cauſes of their ſilence were, as they ſay, <hi>the pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>miſes made by his maiestie both in publique and priuate, the courteous vſage of certain</hi> recuſants <hi>at Hampton courte,</hi> and <hi>his maiesties ſpeech the firſte day of the parliament:</hi> But theſe are matter, that rather mighte moue them to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen theire mouths, and to giue thankes to his Maieſty for his vndeſerued fauors, then either to ſuppreſſe his pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes in ſilence, or to mutinouſly to mutter, and to vtter wordes of diſcontentment, as if they had bene dealt withall hardlie and vniuſtly.

For his promiſes at <hi>Hampton courte,</hi> which are principally vrged, this I anſwere, that in that place, neither was any toleration of religion demanded nor any ſuch matter promiſed. nay the cauſe of the repaire of diuers recuſants thither was the ſuſpition conceiued of them, as if they were guilty of the preeſts treaſon, and not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny new motion for toleration.

That papiſts are excluded out of parlia ment it may be proued falſe by the exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers particulers, which <hi>I</hi> could name if <hi>I</hi> liſt.

                     <p>Thirdly they erre groſſely if they ſuppoſe, that Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments wer founded by papiſts profeſſing the puddle doctrine of the popiſh ſect, flowing out of the ſink of the conuenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle of <hi>Trent,</hi> or that they were made for ſuch as impugne the Kings authority, and adhere to forreigne enemies.</p>

                     <p>Finally it is no new matter, to make motions for reſtrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the inſolency of the maſſeprieſtes and their adherents. For if theſe petitioners be not old, ſuch motions were made before they were borne. King <hi>Henry the</hi> 8. at the motion of his ſubiects repreſſed ſuch. as ſhold attempt to maintain the popes authority, which is a main ground of popery. And long before his time were lawes <hi>of prouiſions, and praemunire</hi> made, to ſtop the popes encrochements and dayly do recuſants giue occaſion to make new lawes againſt them. But admit inaſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prieſts and their adherents and the Popes truely deuoted creatures had been excluded out of parliaments, and that in bills &amp; books they had been charged <hi>as ſectaries, ſuperstitious perſons, hereticks and idolaters;</hi> and further, that his Maieſty had bin moued to take a courſe with them, and the parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to aggrauate their penaltyes. and to prouide for the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution of lawes againſt them; yet haue theſe lame witted lay papiſts no cauſe, eyther to make theſe outcries, or to pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh theſe ſlanderous libells, not onely to the diſgrace of our
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:177776:43"/>late gratious Queen, and <hi>King Edward</hi> that excellent ſpirite, but alſo againſt his maieſty, as if he meant to giue intertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to miſcreants, and knew not how to keepe meaſure in puniſhing papiſts and other ſectaries and heretikes. For firſt the Parliament is no place for ſuch as loue ſtrangers, better then their owne princes, and depend vpon forrayners, rather then their countrimen. Secondly papiſts are no catholikes, nor were parliaments founded eyther by ſuch as beleeued the filthy doctrine of popery pomped out of the popes breſt in the conuenticle of <hi>Trent,</hi> nor for ſuch caitiffs &amp; miſcreants as beleeue that doctrine.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly if ſuch as in England adhere to the Pope, and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitiuely hold his doctrine, be called <hi>hereticks, ſectaries, ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitious perſons and idolaters,</hi> they are not wronged. For the ſame is clearly demonſtrated in diuers treatiſes, and part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in this anſwer. And litle are theſe lame petitioners able to ſay for themſelues to the contrary. Nay they haue fauor, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering their intelligence and practiſes of late with the pope and his agents, that they are not called far worſe.</p>
                     <p>Laſtly they haue no reaſon to complaine of penall lawes made againſt lay-papiſts. for the penalties are only pecunia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and very remiſſely purſued. but the bloudy inquiſitors, and the popes adherents murdre and maſſacre all, that profeſſe true religion, in places where they command, and this had <hi>Percie</hi> and his compagnions doon in England, if they had pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uailed. Further, themſelues will not deny, but that idolaters, heretikes and ſectaries may lawfully be puniſhed. And if they ſhould deny it; yet woulde the examples and practiſe both of <hi>Hezekiah, Ioſiah,</hi> and other godly kings before Chriſts time, and of <hi>Constantine, Theodoſius,</hi> and other chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian emperors ſince chriſtianity began to be profeſſed, plain<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly proue it. But it hath been and ſhall alwayes be plainly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, that papiſts are ſectaries, ſuperſtitious perſons, heretikes, and idolaters.</p>
                     <p>Their feare therefore, leaſt God wold-be offended with them for their ſilence in this cauſe, is ſuperſtitious and very
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:177776:44"/>fooliſh. For god is rather diſpleaſed with ſuch, as ſeeke to erect open idolatry, and to maintaine groſſe ſuperſtition and hereſie, as theſe ignorant lay papiſts, or rather lame Maſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prieſtes ſeek to do; then with ſuch, as keep themſelues within the liſts of their ignorance, and hold their peace.</p>
                     <p>Secondly true it is, as they ſay, that their cauſe is poore, and more porely defended. And therefore great ſimplicity haue they ſhewed in prating of things aboue their capacity, and for this cauſe they ſtand condemned by all true Chriſtians, which wold haue liked much better their ſober ſilence, then their violent and fooliſh libells.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly their Children, whom theſe petitioners, that deuide themſelues from gods church, do deuide from the Chriſtian world, as being no part of it, ſhall in time to come haue iuſt cauſe to curſe ſuch parents as bring them vp in ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance of true religion, and open idolatry. And if they haue grace, will wiſh their babbling parents had neuer medled in this deſperate cauſe.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly ſo far are they from making any iuſt defence a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt their aduerſaries, that they giue both them, and others iuſt cauſe to inſult and tryumph, ſeeing that the wittes of lay papiſts and their teachers beeing ſommed and preſſed toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, no drop of reaſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> or piety hath proceeded from them, to ſeaſon their vnſauory religion.</p>
                     <p>Finally they confeſſe, <hi>that they obſerue no decorum,</hi> and yet profeſſe, <hi>that they will not examine curiouſly, that which by their aduerſaries hath beene thundred out against them, nor diſpute in moode and figure with them.</hi> And yet they pretend to be <hi>deſirous to giue his maieſty all poſſible contentment,</hi> and <hi>an accompt of their beleefe and religion, and a ful and ample ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity and ſatiſfaction,</hi> But if they obſerue no <hi>decorum,</hi> it is not like they will content his Maieſty; and hardly will they giue ſatiſraction to ſo learned and wiſe a prince without cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious examination of matters obiected. They muſt alſo diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute, if not in moode and figure, yet in ſome better forme, then now they do, if they will either proue vnto vs their diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>figured
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:177776:44"/>and euil qualified religion, or els iuſtifie vnto his Maieſty the reaſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of their rude requeſt, that is not only ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed, as approued by ſubſcriptions <hi>of a thouſand hands,</hi> (as that was of the <hi>Millenary miniſters,</hi> of which theſe lay pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts talke idelly) but alſo with the terror of many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands of the popiſh faction, as it were obtruded to his Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie.</p>
                     <p>So we may ſee, that theſe petitioners are able to bring nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther truth, nor reaſon for the iuſtification of their cauſe kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping ſilence, when they ſhould haue ſpoken, and ſpeaking nothing to purpoſe, when they reſolued to breake ſilence. But if we pleaſe to examine the true cauſe both of their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer ſilence, and this preſent petition; we ſhall find, that their ſilence proceeded partly from their great occaſions beeing buſied in diuers practiſes againſt the ſtate, as theſe horrible treaſons lately diſcouered do declare, and partly from the lewdneſſe of their cauſe, that by farre better orators, then theſe laymen, cannot be defended. Contrarywiſe the occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of their petition is not any wrong offered by vs, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a wrong intended by them, and that both to his maieſty and to the ſtate, while bragging of the numbers, forces and correſponde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce with ſtrangers, they endeuor to ſtrike a terror into his maieſty, and buzzing theſe fooliſh tales into the ears of the multitude, deſire to trouble the peace of the ſtate. But the ſtate of things being well known, neither ſhall his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſty haue cauſe to feare their threats, nor the people reaſon to beleeue their fooliſh tales. For as they feede themſelues, (like as all fugitiues and malcontents do) with a fond conceit of their owne ſtrength without grounds of reaſon, ſo they feed their readers with words, and ſhewes, without any ſound demonſtration of any point of their erroneous religion. God grant, that the ſimple ſeduced papiſt may as well apprehend it, as we ſhall prooue it; and then will they hereafter be more wary, how they venture their ſtate and ſoules vpon the maſſe-prieſts warrant, who vpon the hazard and loſſe of others, doe
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:177776:45"/>reape no ſmall aduantage now, and ſeek to bring all into ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenture hereafter.</p>

Many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther particulers there are in theſe two chapters worthy to bee cenſured.

                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the Kings true ſubiects. next they muſt bring forth the rolls of the miniſters of papiſts, and name them, or elſe no man wil beleue them.

                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly</hi> they talke very idlely of the dignity of Engliſh papiſts. But they name no one man of that ſort, that either for his greate ſeruice in warres, or peace deſerueth any ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler commendation. Therefore they runne out into a long re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herſall of matters forepaſt, and talke of theire aunceſtors ſaying, that <hi>they haue deſerued wel of this co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monwealth.</hi> But as well might the Moderne Romanes alledge the greate ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uices and noble actes of <hi>Scipio, Paulus Aemilius, Sylla, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius, Catulus, Caeſar, Cicero, Cato</hi> and others, or of the aunci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Troyans, from whom they pretend to be deſcended. they commend their aunceſters alſo for theire loue &amp; fidelitie vnto theire princes.

And J hope they will not deny, that <hi>Brooke, Markham, Watſon</hi> and theire complices were popiſh recuſants, or that the attempt of the Spaniards anno 1588, was againſte theire country, and ſet forward by papiſts. Laſtly it is notorious, that <hi>Percy, Cateſby, Digby,</hi> and all theire conſortes were deſperate recuſants, and that they lifted vp not onely theire fingars, but alſo theire whole armes and bodies againſt the king. yet ſhould a man bee very ſtrangely conceited, if hee thought they ment no harme to their prince and country.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly</hi> they runne out into a large diſcourſe of <hi>theire hard vſage in the late Queenes time,</hi> as they call it, and of the Queens proceeding againſt them, and of the effectes thereof enſuing, &amp; pray the king to follow <hi>her rather in her, diſpoſitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to mildneſſe, then in her other hard and ſharp courſes.</hi> But firſt al this diſcourſe is from the purpoſe, and the intent propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in the 3. chapter. for therein they ſhoulde declare vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vs the eſtate and qualities of Papiſts, and not the procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings of our late Queene of bleſſed memory. <hi>Secondly</hi> the ſameis moſt ſlanderous charging that moſte gratious and clement Queen <hi>with hard ſharp and bloody courſes.</hi> But this is all that Chriſtian princes are to looke for at theſe mens hands, or penns.

Laſtly they doe therein bewray the weakenes of the pope, and the fading force of antichriſtes kingdome. For now the pope doth not hold his hands from excommunicating the king at the requeſt of <hi>Bethune,</hi> or <hi>Gifford,</hi> or any ſuch baſe fellowe, but becauſe he feareth his rayling and curſing wold eyther take no effect againſte the king, or elſe ouerthrowe the credit of Antichriſts thunderbolts.</p>

                     <hi>Laſtly</hi> they ſeeme to haue theire braynes diſtempred, that are made to beleeue, that the popiſh ſacrifice of the maſſe for quick and deade, their carnall eating of Chriſts fleſh with the mouths of men, nay with the mouth of bruit beaſts, their tranſubſtantiation, halfe communions, and idolatrous wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of the ſacrament, the popes vniuerſall and plenary pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er conteined in decretales, their 7. ſacraments, and doctrine of iuſtification by orders, mariage and extreame vnction, theyr worſhip of ſaints, reliques, and images, and all the reſt of their abhominable doctrine may be proued by authority of <hi>ſcriptures, fathers, ſaints, doctors, councels, Parliamentes,</hi> and that the ſame is confirmed dy <hi>vnitie, vniuerſality, ſucceſſion,</hi> and. <hi>antiquity,</hi> beſide the teſtimony of virgins and <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs,</hi> This we may affirme of the Apoſtles creed, and the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike fayth taught and publiſhed in auncient Councels, but by no meanes of the fayth of the moderne ſinagogue of <hi>Rome.</hi> Nay in our abridgemente, or <hi>ſuruey of Poperie</hi> we haue plainely demonſtrated that the ſame is contrary to ſcriptures, fathers, councels, auncient writers, and is deuoyde of the teſtimonies of martyres virgins, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees of Parliaments, and all other authenticall proofes.</p>
                  <p>Secondly they alledge, <hi>that neuer any vniverſall innoua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in matters of religion hath been made, but that the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion and vocation of the meſſengers hath beene autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſed by ſignes and wonders.</hi> But this allegation, as it concear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:177776:53"/>vs nothing, ſo it vtterly ouerthroweth the petitioners cauſe. For we haue made no vniuerſal innonatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Nay we do not alter or abrogate-any one article of the Chriſtian faith, but as in <hi>Spaine</hi> true teachers in former tymes cauſed <hi>Aria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſme</hi> to ceaſe and true religion to bee receiued, and as the Chriſtians in the land of <hi>Paleſtine</hi> ſome 400. yeares ſence for a time cauſed the impieties of <hi>Mahomet</hi> to be ſuppreſſed, &amp; Chriſtian religion to be taught and practiſed, ſo do we onely aboliſh the corruptions, falſe doctrines, hereſies, and impie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of popery, and reteine euery article of the Auncient chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian fayth. But the maſſepreeſts, friars and monkes adhering to the Pope haue made an vniuerſall alteration in the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of God, bringing in the idolatrous worſhip of ſaints, of images, of the ſacrament, and receiuing many old condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned hereſies, and new deuiſed ſchoole doctrines and decre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taline deuiſes, and yet neither ſhew ſignes nor wonders, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe a man liſt to beleeue the wondrous lyes of their le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gends and breuiaries.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly</hi> they take it as a matter <hi>moſt euident, and that ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be denied, that the firſt apoſtles and conuerters of Engla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d Scotland, Ireland, France, and Germany were ſent from the Church of Rome, and deliuered vs the ſame fayth which the Papiſts now profeſſe.</hi> But they take boldly and affirme impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently that, which no man either giueth them, or yeeldeth to bee true. Parſons hath ſpent much idle talke in this argument, and proueth nothing. <hi>Coleton</hi> is as mute, as if hee were turned into a Codfiſh, and replieth nothing to that which is anſwered to the petition of Maſſeprecſtes the laſt ſeſſion of parliament, and their diſcourſe touching this poynt. As for theſe petitioners, they ſhewe themſelues ignorant of learning, that beleeue, that the doctrine of Romiſh traditions of the Popes authority, of the maſſe, of the 7. ſacramentes, of Purgatory and indulgences, and ſuch like matters was known to the ancie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t Biſhops of <hi>Rome.</hi> but ſuppoſe old <hi>Rome</hi> had ſent true preachers abroade, to conuert nations to the Chriſtian fayth, what is that to new Rome, that ſendeth out
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:177776:54"/>falſe apoſtles, to corrupt the true fayth, and aſſaſſins &amp; Cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throates to murder ſuch, as fauour the truth? this falſe doctrine and cut throate practiſe certes was neuer confirmed with true ſignes and wonders.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fourthlie</hi> they require vs <hi>to ſhew a Commiſſion from God,</hi> if we meane to conuince the papiſts, <hi>that they haue not true ſcriptures, or interpret them not right,</hi> or <hi>that they are idolaters, or hereticks:</hi> a deuiſe likely to proceed from ſuch idle heades. For neither did thoſe fathers, that conuinced the <hi>Marcio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nists, Arrians, Manichees, Angelicks</hi> and other hereticks ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of corrupting, or miſconſtruing the ſcriptures, or any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther poynt of falſe doctrine, ſhew a commiſſion immediat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from god, neither doe the maſſe preeſts, that diſpute nowe againſt <hi>Turks, Arrians,</hi> and <hi>Anabaptiſts</hi> ſhewe forth any ſuch commiſſion. All Chriſtians and not onelie publike teachers haue commiſſion, ſufficient, to deſcry &amp; to take heed of falſe Prophets, that come vnto them in ſheeps clothing, but inward<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly are rauening wolues. What needeth then this extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary authority?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fiftly</hi> they tellvs, <hi>that we had our ſcriptures from Rome,</hi> and <hi>had been ſcriptureleſſe, if we had not receiued them from thence He ſayth alſo, that the ſame bible, which Anguſtine brought into England, is yet. reſerued by gods eſpeciall prouidence.</hi> But firſte it is not materiall, from whence Chriſtians receiue ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſcriptures. The <hi>Romaines</hi> receiued them from the <hi>Iewes</hi> and yet I trow Parſons and <hi>Coletou,</hi> as they are turned <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maniſts,</hi> will not turne <hi>Iewes. Secondly</hi> that the <hi>Britous</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued the ſcriptures from the Romanes, it is not likely, they being, as the common report goeth, conuerted by <hi>Ioſeph of Arimathaea.</hi> Neither doe theſe petitioners ſhew, where the Bible is to be foud, that was brought in by <hi>Auſten</hi> the Monk, nor doe they make proofe, that this which they ſhew, is the the ſame Bible, which <hi>Austen</hi> brought in. Jf it bee the old vulgar tranſlation, it is not likely, that <hi>Gregory</hi> ſent it. For he doth not alwayes follow that tranſlation. Heere alſo they tell vs, that <hi>we haue reiected and diſcanonized</hi> diuers <hi>bookes of
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:177776:54"/>ſcripture, becauſe they be expreſſe teſtimonyes againste our reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,</hi> which it pleaſeth them to cal <hi>new and negatiue.</hi> But nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doe we reiect any booke of canonicall ſcripture, nor can any argument be drawne from the bookes apocryphall added in the vulgarlatin tranſlation to the old teſtame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, that doeth hurt vs. Furthermore if we do onely deny the hereſies of the papiſts, then doe we not frame any new religion vnto ourſelues. and if the papiſts affirme matters not known to fathers, then is theire religion new &amp; poſitiue, if not wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked in the ſuperlatiue. For the ſence of, ſcripture they tell vs that <hi>we haue onely the warrant of our priuate ſpirit,</hi> and <hi>they the aſſistance of gods holy ſpirit promiſed to his Church.</hi> But ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdly they talke of the interpretation of ſcriptures follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing therein the priuate ſence of a ſenceleſſe pope, and nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the interpretation conſonant to the meaning of gods ho<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly ſpirit ſpeaking in ſcriptures, nor to the iudgement of fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers vpon whome they bragge moſt fondly. Laſtly they tell vs againe of <hi>parliaments and princes</hi> and ſay, that <hi>for one of ours, they haue an hundred,</hi> but they ſhew themſelues ſhame leſſe, to ſpeake vntruth without any ſhew of proofe. For if they looke into all hiſtories, they ſhall not finde eyther par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament or prince within this realme, that allowed the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked decrees of the conuenticle of <hi>Trent.</hi> Neither did the clergy or the vniuerſityes of England euer approue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Here againe they they tell vs of <hi>a child King,</hi> and, <hi>woman Queene,</hi> as if they had Queens, that were no women, or diſallowed of the ſucceſſion of children to their fathers. So their fift rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is very childiſh.</p>
                  <p>Their ſixth reaſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> had been more allowable, if they could haue proued theire antecedent. For if <hi>their faith, had been that, which Saint. Paule ſo highly commendeth,</hi> and which was firſt taught the Engliſh by <hi>Gregorie;</hi> then ſhould wee not much contend with them about matters of fayth. But helas poret ſoules, theſe laypapiſtes read not <hi>S. Paules</hi> Epiſtles, nor canne they tell, what he taught. and as for their Maſters, they ſhall proue themſelues deſperate fellowes, if thèy take vpon them
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:177776:55"/>to proue their tranſubſtantiation, and maſſing ſacrifice, and other poynts of popery out of S. Paule. they ſhould alſo but a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſe their readers, if they ſhould vndertake to proue, that popery is Catholike doctrine, as hath been often ſhewed. Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally if <hi>Gregorie</hi> the firſte were iudge, yet ſhould they nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther proue the popiſh worſhip of images, nor the vniuerſall headſhip of the pope, nor the inuiſibility and impalpability of Chriſtes body in the ſacrament. the contrary rather, out of <hi>Gregoryes</hi> doctrine may be concluded.</p>
                  <p>The 7. reaſon is nothing els but a repetition of matters for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly denyed. They ſay <hi>we haue receiued our Bible, our goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, and the canons from the Church of Rome.</hi> The truth is, that all true Chriſtians haue receiued both the Bible &amp; the Goſpell from Chriſt, and his Apoſtles-likewiſe we haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued auncient canons from auncient general councels, &amp; from the ſame the Church of Rome hath receiued both lawes and canons. But the doctrine of the modern churche of <hi>Rome</hi> concerning the 7. ſacramentes, halfe communions the carnall eating of Chriſtes body with the mouth, and ſuch like Myſteries of the maſſe they are contrary both to ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and actes of councels, and were neuer knowne to the auncient church of <hi>Rome.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In theire 8. reaſon they affirme, <hi>that the Romiſh Church is our Mother Church.</hi> But then is ſhe a cruell mother, that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuteth and murthreth her children. Of the old <hi>Roman</hi> Church diuers nations receiued the faith, and therefore to them ſhe might be reputed the Mother church, and ſo his maieſty meant, when he ſpoke of the old church of <hi>Rome.</hi> But this later <hi>Romiſh</hi> church is rather a ſtepmother, then a mother, and rather the mother of fornications. as Saint John calleth her, or the mother of errors, as <hi>Francis Petrarch</hi> cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth her, then the mother of Chriſtians. nay we haueby di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers reaſons demonſtrated, that ſhe is neither the mother church, nor Chriſts church, but the whore of <hi>Babylon,</hi> and Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagogue of <hi>Antichriste.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Their ninth reaſon is drawne from the maner of the firſte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <pb n="101" facs="tcp:177776:55"/>ariſing, and condemnation of hereſyes. For if there neuer yet aroſe any hereſy, but both the names of the authors, and of the councells that condemned them, were well known: then if neither the authors of the maſſe, or of Purgatory, or of pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers to ſaints can be named, nor any councell found out that condemned them, then they ſuppoſe, that theſe poyntes came from Chriſt, and the apoſtles. But by the ſame reaſon hee mighte prooue that the hereſie of the <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelikes, Collyridians, Meſſalians, Nudipedalls, Nazarites, Apoſtolikes,</hi> and diuers of that ſorte came from <hi>Christ</hi> and the Apoſtles. For neither is <hi>Coleton</hi> able to name the firſt authors of theſe hereſyes, nor excepte it bee the <hi>Angelikes</hi> condemned in the councell of <hi>Laodicea,</hi> can hee ſhew, that any of theſe hereticks were condemned by coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels. Further wee ſhew, who were the firſt deuiſers of the maſſe, and theſe lay papiſts confeſſe, that the author of <hi>euery little ceremony</hi> and the time thereof is known. we knowalſo, that purgatory for ſatiſfaction for te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>poral pains after that the guilt of ſin is remitted, &amp; praiers to ſaynts was firſt deuiſed by ſchoolmen among chriſtians, &amp; by idolaters among Heathen men.</p>
                  <p>Their laſt reaſon is deriued from the fruites of true religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which, as they ſay <hi>are loue, vnity, concord, piety, acts of cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, and deuotion, as fasting praier, almes, building of monaſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryes, erecting of vniuerſities, founding of Hoſpitals, conuerting of Nations,</hi> and ſuch like. But firſt the erection of monaſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, and ſuch like dennes of ſuperſtitious perſons, and <hi>Sodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mites,</hi> is neither a worke of Charity, nor deuotion. <hi>Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> theſe fruites of religion, that are heere mentioned, neuer proceeded from the modern ſuperſtition of <hi>Rome.</hi> And that is moſt apparent, not only by common experience, but alſo by the teſtimony and confeſſion of papiſts themſelues. In Jtaly &amp; other countries, where popery moſte reigneth there is little true loue, no vnitie, nor concord either among the teachers, or among their followers, no ſteppe of chriſtian piety, no acts
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:177776:56"/>of Chriſtian charity, nor ſigne of ſincere and internall deuoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. their prayers are directed to ſaynts &amp; angels for the moſt part, and little vnderſtood of the vulgar ſort, being in ſtrange la<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>guages. Their faſts ar ſuperſtitious their alms ar phariſaical, &amp; for the moſt part euil beſtowed. The popes &amp; their co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>plices maſſacre &amp; murdre true chriſtians, &amp; with deadly, hatred pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſequute on another, Their enemies they empoyſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp; murdre, &amp; ſuch as they cannot kill, they curſe and hate. They make banks of vſury, &amp; ſet vp bordell houſes for maintenance of whoredom &amp; baudry. they haue empoueriſhed chriſtians, &amp; occaſioned the progreſſe and ſucceſſe of <hi>Turkes.</hi> and as for new <hi>Rome</hi> it hath confuted no hereſyes, nor called any law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full councels, nor erected any vniuerſityes, nor taught any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience to princes. nay contrariwiſe, the popes of <hi>Rome</hi> haue diſſolued the bands of obedience, and with preferring men vnworthy, &amp; foſtering Iebuſites haue ouerthrowne v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niuerſities. Finally; teaching that the pope is aboue councels, they haue taken away al authority fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> councels, &amp; teaching the idolatrous worſhip of ſaynts, images, and the ſacrament, and ſetting for ward their traditions they haue deſtroyed all religion. and this in the abridgement or ſuruey of popery is proued both by teſtimonyes and examples: agaynſt vs certes they ſhall neuer be able to prooue any ſuch matters. They charge Maſter <hi>Caluin, Knox, Luther &amp; Godma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with teaching co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pt of power &amp; authority, and neglect of laws &amp; obedience, &amp; that vnder the colour of liberty of the goſpel.</hi> But this is a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> practiſe of papiſts, when they are at a ſtoppe, to father lies vpon <hi>Luther Caluin</hi> and other godly men. How ſincerely they deale, it is apparent, when they alledge ſuch authors, as lay papiſts vnder payne of exco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mu nication may not read, &amp; affirme that to bee taughte by them, which thoſe godly teachers vtterly diſlike and condemne. Abſurdly al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, wher they vndertake to defend themſelues, they run out into an accuſation of others, ſayling as it were without com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe, albeit they pretend, that theire petition was printed <hi>at
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:177776:56"/>the ſigne of the compaſſe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If then the papiſts vpon pretence of theſe abſurd allega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions deſire conference or diſputation, then is their caſe deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate, and their hopes fruteleſſe. For as caſily ſhall we an<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſwere by word, as we anſwer now by writing, of the diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s in the tower betwixt ſome of ourlerned men, &amp; <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pion</hi> &amp; his mates they haue no reaſon to make any vants nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther had either the Lord <hi>Vaux,</hi> or <hi>Treſham</hi> or <hi>Cateſbie</hi> any greate iudgement to offer mony to be praeſent at the confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence. for that poyſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> did they taſt there that hath ruined both Treſhams, and Cateſbyes progeny, &amp; Campion was put down with a word of Greek, and found vnable to mayntein his own pamphlet, and much more to vphold the ruinous cauſe of papiſts. This certes we hardly beleeue, that either they offred ſuch great ſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mes of mony to be preſent at the confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, or. that their ſute was denyed. For we are not hardly entreated to diſpute, nor loth to be heard, and now if theſe ſuppliantes or theire teachers think they can do any maſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryes, let them propoſe their argumentes to the view of the world in writing, that all men may know the cauſe, and wee aſſure them, they ſhalnot want anſwere by tongue &amp; penne. and if that will not ſerue, then let them procure vs the like ſecurity and liberty in <hi>Spaine</hi> and <hi>Italy,</hi> that they deſire in <hi>England</hi> and, then they ſhall not be refuſed.</p>
                  <p>In the mean while I would pray theſe ſuppliants either by theſelues or their teachers to iuſtifie this petition, and to take away this our anſwere, and that they woulde bee pleaſed to anſwere al the particuler poyntes either of our challenge which are paſſed ouerby <hi>Walpoole.</hi> or of our ſuruey of po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery where for one reaſon they bring for popery, they ſhall haue a hundred of more ſtrength agaynſt it.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Now we come,</hi> ſay the petitioners, <hi>to the matter of our loyalty,</hi> but that this is an argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, that hitherto they haue not attei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to it. they tel vs alſo <hi>of the matter of their loyalty.</hi> But nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther do they bring any thing materiall, nor do their wordes agree with their doctrine.

                  <p>Three wayes they aſſigne <hi>for a prudent maiſter to try out the honesty and fidelity of his ſeruant accuſed of trecherie.</hi> and yet neuer a one ſufficient. For neither is it ſufficient to <hi>make inquiſition of his former life and behauiour,</hi> nor <hi>to looke into his preſent cariage and quality,</hi> nor <hi>to compare his actions &amp; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portments with thoſe that traduce him:</hi> which are the onely meanes of triall, which theſe petitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ers could deuiſe. But the gouernors of ſtate muſt further looke to the trecherous opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:177776:62"/>which they defend, and to the intelligences they haue both at home and abroade. further they muſt look not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to their owne demeanour, but alſo to the atteſtations of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. agayne little doth it make for the clearing of traytors or felons, to ſhew that their aduerſaries ar faulty, and no ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> eſteemeth of a man by outward cariage and complementes. <hi>Finally</hi> without ſence and feling of true religion &amp; of a good conſcience no man can be truly obedient. as long then as the Papiſts are delighted with the vaine allurements of the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of fornications, and trade with the maſſe preeſts and other marchants of Babilon, their loyallty will be doubtfull and their faire lookes ſuſpicious, But did wee reſpect no more then theſe three poyntes here offred to be conſidered; yet would it goe hard with the maſſepreeſts, and moſt of the recuſants in his maieſties dominions. For the maſſe preeſtes haue all of them the beaſts marke, and are all the ſlaues of the pope, and depend wholly vpon him: and the recuſants &amp; adherents of this generaton are not cleare of ſuſpicion. For firſte we finde, that ſence the yeare of our Lord 1568, diuers of them haue borne armes againſte theire ſoueraigne; as the lay rebels of the north, and of Ireland, all ſworn papiſts. Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe did the rebels in king Henry the 8, his dayes, that roſe about the ſuppreſſing of abbeys, and the rebels of <hi>Cornewall and Deuonſhiere</hi> in King <hi>Edwardes</hi> dayes, that fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues greeued for want of greaſing, croſſing, cenſing and holy water, and ſuch like ceremonyes. <hi>Secondly</hi> diuers of them haue abandoned their prince and country, &amp; fled to forrein enemies, as the multitude of wandring <hi>Engliſh</hi> ſpyes &amp; male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contentes through <hi>Spain, Italy, and Flanders</hi> doth declare. <hi>Thirdly</hi> it is apparent, that the principall motiues to ſtirre vp forrayne princes againſt the ſtate, haue been recuſants. the ſame is teſtified in the declaration of <hi>Sixtus Quintus</hi> againſt our vertuous and religious Queene <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> in the fedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious libell of <hi>Parſons and Allen to the nobility and people of England</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> in <hi>Sanders</hi> his factious booke <hi>de ſchiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate,</hi> and proued by diuers letters and Negotiatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of <hi>Engle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field,
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:177776:63"/>Norton, Parſons,</hi> and others. <hi>Fourthly</hi> ſome of this ſort came with the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> armada <hi>an. D.</hi> 1588. and others were to folow. Likewiſe did they follow the Adelantado in the enterpriſe by ſea. an. 1598. and of <hi>D. Iuan d' Aquila</hi> into Jreland. 1600. and much did the forrein enemy depend vpon the intelligence and forces of recuſants, as is made euident by the <hi>Adelantadoes</hi> proclamation. <hi>Fifily</hi> I hope the recuſa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts will not deny, but that they haue depended in tyme paſt, and purpoſe ſtill to depend vpon the pope, and muſt be forward in exequuting his bulles. 6. no ſmall numbre of Papiſts haue ſerued forrein enemyes, &amp; receiued penſions fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: which is no good argument of loyall cariage. 7. the archpreeſts factio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hath lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g ſtood for the infa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>taes title, againſt his maieſty, &amp; no doubt reteine the ſame humor ſtil, but that the kings ſtre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gth doth keepe them in tempre. 8: <hi>Sa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mier</hi> the <hi>Iebuſite</hi> co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming diſguiſed into <hi>England,</hi> about the yeare of our Lord 1585. did plot ſo with diuers principall recuſants in <hi>England,</hi> as is teſtiſied by the <hi>Ieſuites</hi> catechiſme, that he brought his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſties Mother, and diuers others to theire deſtruction. 9. we find, that the principal men, that in King Edward the 6. his dayes hindred the vnio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland,</hi> and the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uancement of the ſtate of late tyme, were papiſts, and that the quarrel about religion hath beene the cheefe ſtay thereof. 10. euery man knoweth, that the principall contriuers of that treaſon, for which <hi>Watſon, Clerk and Brooke</hi> were exequuted were preeſts and reculants. So likewiſe were <hi>Pearcy, Cateſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bie, Digby, Treſham</hi> and their conſorts, that by fire and gun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powderment to make an end of the King and his Royal pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geny. They were, I ſay, moſt refolute, and principall popiſh recuſants, and thought by fire and gunpowder to make good theire Romiſh fayth. And ſhall any man ſo farre exceed all duty and modeſty to make ſuch felowes loyall? Finally ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing al papiſts profeſſe to ſerue the Pope deuoutly, they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſerue the king faithfully, that is ſo contrary to him in reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion. For no man can ſerue two contrary maſters.</p>
                  <p>To let former practiſes paſſe, euery papiſt now is ſo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bined
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:177776:63"/>with the Pope, that he is bound to follow him, and to exequute his cenſures. Neither if they were aſked the queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, would they either condemne former rebellions for po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh religion, being warra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted by the Pope, or reſiſt the popes forces inuading vs, or ſtand with the king being excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated. But howſoeuer they woulde promiſe, their do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine is ſuch, as no loyal ſubiect can hold it. For their maſters teach, <hi>that the king is ſubiect to the pope,</hi> that <hi>the Pope hath power to depoſe kings and to aſſoyle ſubiects from their obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence vnto them:</hi> that <hi>the king is not to make Eccleſiasticall lawes, nor to meddle with the gouernment of the church,</hi> but as an exequutioner of the popes laws, <hi>that Eccleſiaſticall per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons and their goods are exempt from the kings gouernment,</hi> &amp; diuers others ſuch diſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>oy all poynts.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, if we compare popiſh recuſants eyther with aunci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, or moderne true Chriſtians; we ſhall eaſily perceiue a mayn difference betwixt them. For neither doe we read, that ancient or later Chriſtians did murther their kings, that were Heathen, nor that they thoughte it lawfull to doe ſuch an act, as the leaguers of <hi>France</hi> did, nor that they allowed either the breach of oathes, or the rebellions of ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects againſt their kings, nor that they beleeued thoſe treche<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rous poynts of doctrine, which papiſts of late both beleeue, and teach.</p>
                  <p>Now then let vs proceed on with our diſcourſe, and conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, whether theſe lay papiſts haue either anſwered theſe ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iections, or broughte any matter ſufficient to cleare them ſelues, and their conſorts from the iuſt imputations of infide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, and diſloyalty toward their princes. Both which poynts may be reſolued by examination of the particuler poyntes of this fift chapter, wherein they tell firſt, <hi>that before their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrainte for recuſancy ſome of them bare offices in the common wealth, and were dignified by the Queen,</hi> and that others had <hi>there putation, of worſhipfull and honeſt men.</hi> But if they me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to haue iuſtified their former cariage as they pretended &amp; promiſed; then ſhould they haue told vs of their loyal affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:177776:64"/>to their prince, and of theire good ſeruices performed for their country. They ſhould alſo aſwell haue mentioned the cauſe of populer recuſants, as of the gentlemen. But herein they altogether fayled. For neither do they clear themſelues nor their co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſorts of thoſe trecherous practiſes &amp; doctrines formerly noted, nor are they able to bring proofe of either good affection or good action &amp; ſeruice performed for their prince &amp; country. But where they talk of the <hi>diguifiing of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny recuſants by the Queene;</hi> inſteed of diſcharging themſelues they charge the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues with great vnthankfulneſſe and diſloy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty, that alwaies hated and perſequuted her, which ceaſed not to dignify and honor them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly</hi> they ſay <hi>their behanior after theire reſtraint was ſuch as became Catholike Christians towards christian ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates with all humility, reſpect, modesty and ſubiection.</hi> But this would, rather haue beſeemed ſome others to ſpeak, then the laye papiſtes: who for want of good neighbors ruune out into an high commendation of themſelues. Further more neither are priſoners much to be commended for car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying themſelues modeſtly and reſpectiuely, ſeing priſons at no places for men to exceed, and grow proud &amp; rebellious, nor did the papiſts (here falſely called Catholikes) keepe themſelues in ſo good temper, and ordre, but that they were to be charged with diuers intelligences, correſpondences, &amp; practiſes with the enemies of the ſtate. as appeareth in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordes concerning <hi>Throckmorton, Arden, Someruille, Babing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, Abington, Parry, Brooke,</hi> and others. And although for want of meanes and occaſions they broke not forth alwaies into open action, yet their modeſty &amp; ſubiectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> did neuer ſo far reſtrein the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but they thought it lawful to kil and murder, &amp; depoſe princes exco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>municated by the pope, &amp; vnlawful to obey ſuch without diſpe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, eſpecialiy in eccleſiaſtical cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes. that therfor which they talk of <hi>obeying princes not for anger but for conſcience ſake,</hi> and of their carriage <hi>without ſhadowe of diſloyalty, and</hi> of <hi>theire integrity</hi> and <hi>vnimpeachable de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meanor,</hi> is nothing elſe, but a vaine brag without colour or
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:177776:64"/>ſhadowe of modeſty. For their conſcience is ruled by the popes will, and their practiſes, treaſons, and rebellions are recorded both in ſtory, and in the Crown office. Further<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more their treacherous doctrine agaynſte the authoritye of Kings is publiſhed in their owne bookes, and cannot be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed by themſelues.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly they tell his maieſty, what offers were made by certaine recuſantes in the ile of of Ely, and by the lord <hi>Vaux</hi> anno 1588. when the Spaniſh and the popes forces came a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſte theire country. but many things are often offered, that are ſlenderly performed and ſuch no doubt, would the ſeruice haue been that is or was offered by them, who ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red more the Popes thunderboltes, then the princes double cannons, and onely deſired to free themſelues out of priſon, that they mighte after take part with the ſtronger. to deſire to bee <hi>placed in the forefront of the battel in theire ſhirts,</hi> they had no reaſon, vnleſſe they had meante after they hadde put of their armes and clothes, to runne awaye more ligtly. My Lord <hi>Vaux</hi> was ſo good a man of warre, that I woulde wiſh no greater benefit to England, then that all our ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myes were ſuch. But ſuppoſe ſome few recuſants did offer to ſerue the Queen; yet neither had ſhe reaſon to truſt them, nor we to beleeue, that all the reſt of the recuſants meant to ſerue her faithfully, being ſworn vaſſals to the pope her ſworn ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my. Vnhappy had this land beene, if theire prayers and vowes had been performed. Foralbeit ſome papiſts then did acknow<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ledge the Queenes; authority, notwithſtanding the popes excommunications; yet that was, for that the excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion did not bind them vntill ſuch tyme, as the Popes bulle might be put in exequntion, as appeareth by the faculties granted to <hi>Parſons</hi> and <hi>Campian.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fourthly</hi> out of <hi>England</hi> they runne into Ireland to tell vs of the fidelity of <hi>Iriſh</hi> papiſts. But it appeareth thoſe men ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer came there to trye it. they ſhew ſo greate ignorance of the <hi>Iriſh,</hi> and of the affaires of <hi>Ireland.</hi> For in the battaile at <hi>Kiuſale</hi> they cannot name 10. Jriſh, that did any greate ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice.
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:177776:65"/>At other times the moſt part alwayes abandoned and betrayed thoſe that relied vpon them, and euer for one Iriſh man, that truly ſerued the Quene, there might bee recke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned 10. that willingly ſerued the rebells, And this ſhould the king finde at theire hands, J feare, if he had occaſion to trie them If then theſe petitioners haue no better argumentes to proue the fidelity of recuſants then ſuch as theſe, they will not proue <hi>refined gold,</hi> nor good copper, but rather Corke guilt ouer like gold, or ſome ſuch other light and ſlight ſtuffe good for nothing.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fiftly</hi> they tell his maieſty of the affection and behauiour of papiſts toward his predeceſſors, himſelfe and his title, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther forgetting King Henry the 7. nor King <hi>Edward</hi> the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſor. But all the queſtion being concerning the moderne papiſts, and theire loyalty to princes of contrary religion; who ſeeth not, how farre theire diſcourſe runneth out, and is tranſcendent aboue theire purpoſe? the welſhmen of our tyme may with better reaſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> alledge the noble acts of <hi>Hector</hi> and <hi>Aeneas,</hi> of Troy, or of king <hi>Brute,</hi> King <hi>Arthur,</hi> or ſome auncient famous man of Britayne, How much they fauored the King it appeareth by diuers attempts againſt him in <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>land.</hi> and by the treaſon of <hi>Clerk, VVatſon, Copley, Brooke, Markham,</hi> and now lately of <hi>Percy, Cateſby</hi> and others, ſence his comming into <hi>England. Parſons and Coluill</hi> direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly oppugned the Kings title, in books in print, and to that boke, which <hi>Parſons</hi> ſet out as is ſaide, in diuers languages, the Iebuſitical faction yeelded a greate applauſe. Many of them alſo as the ſeculer preeſtes charged them, ſubſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed vnto it.</p>
                  <p>Jf then nowe they pretend to fauour the kinges title, it is becauſe it were booteleſſe and dangerous now to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugne it. likewiſe the papiſtes, that heeretofore wrote and ſpake in defence of his Maieſties Mother, and of the Kinges title, reſpected nothing elſe, but theire owne particuler, thinking by theire gloſing wordes, either to bring in Pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:177776:65"/>or to aduaunce theire owne priuate pretences. Finally they ſhew, they haue great Confidence in his Maieſties cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mency, that, <hi>they haue refuſed to pay the twenty pound a month due for recuſancy,</hi> albeit the penalty be greate.</p>
                  <p>But here they ſhoulde rather alledge cauſe to moue the King to truſt them, then to ſhew, that they may aſſuredlie truſt the Kings mercy, whoſe Clemency is ſo exceeding, and word ſo aſſured. Further this rather argueth their diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bediente, and repugning humor, then iuſtifieth theire ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber diſpoſition and deſire to be loyal. <hi>Laſtly</hi> they ſhewe a great differe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce betwixt the gentle proceeding of true chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, that with light penaltyes ſeeke to winne men, and are ſlow in exacting them, and the rigor and cruelty of papiſtes that confiſcate all the Lands and goods of true Chriſtians, &amp; moſt barbarouſly torment and maſſacre their perſons with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out pitty or mercy. Jf then our lay papiſtes haue no better defences nor prete<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces for their fidelity, then they haue formerly alledged, theire owne words will rather conuince them, then cleare them, and ſuch, as had no euill opinion of recuſants before, will take occaſion to ſuſpect, that this ſtubble of theirs is nothing, but a couer for the ſeed of much hartburning, diſcontentment and diſloyalty, as their billetts. and fagots of late were laid to couer their barrels of gunpow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der couched vnder the higher houſe of Parliament.</p>

But yet no parte of the petition is more looſely or fooliſhly handled. For firſt in this concluſion they inuolue a requeſt for their maſſepreſts, hauing ſpoken nothing of thém before which is alone, as if they ſhould con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude without premiſſes.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly</hi> they require <hi>ſome quiet, graue, and vertuous cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy men for the comfort of their ſouls.</hi> But this is ſpoken againſt the polſhorne Preſtes of Antichriſt.

They are not vertuous, but baſe, filthy and leche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous fellowes. and this is proued by diuers particulers. Final<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the confort of Chriſtian mens ſoules confiſteth not in facul<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ties, indulgences, popiſh abſolutions and ſuch antichriſtian traſh as they bring, but in <hi>Christs</hi> ſweete promiſes, and in apo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſtolike doctrine, and comfortable wordes of true preachers
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:177776:74"/>and to ſuch if they would open their eares, they ſhould haue both quiet, graue &amp; vertuous clergy men, and true and godly paſtors alſo.</p>

For firſt they teſtify againſt themſelues Queen <hi>Elizabeths</hi> greate Cleme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cy, that ſpared the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, who had dealt ſo rigorously her ſelf &amp; others, &amp; did not proced againſt the papiſts, before they began to practiſe &amp; atte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pt againſt her <hi>Secondly</hi> wee ſeeheerin, that al fauor doon to papiſts is loſt, as beſtowed vpon vngratful perſons, &amp; enemies irreconcilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. We may deal mercifully with the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; giue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> life, that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe wold periſh. But if they haue once the ſword in their hands, they ſatiffy the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſelues with nothing but the death and deſtruction of ſuch, as profeſſe the truth. But to let this paſſe, little doth the exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple of Queene <hi>Maryes</hi> preeſts relieue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. For they were made preeſts at home, theſe by forreine ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myes. they acknowledged the princes ſupreme authority, theſe defend the authority of the Pope. They depe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded on the princes grace &amp; fauor: theſe depe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d on the popes grace, &amp; withal their forces defe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d his authority they offe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded of igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce notknowing the truth, theſe of malice ru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ning out of their countrie, and oppugning a truth once known.

Finally</hi> they acknowledged the Queens mercy: theſe bark at her being dead, &amp; neuer ceaſed to work againſt her being aliue. For proofe of the <hi>conformity of their petition to reaſon,</hi> they adde in the fourth place, <hi>that no religion did or cold euer conſiſt without preestes and paſtors.</hi> But what is that to theſe preeſts of Baal, that at no true Prceſts ſucceeding the Apoſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les in teching &amp; adminiſtring ſacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts according to chriſts inſtitution, but idolatrous ſacrificers ordeined by Antichriſt

Laſtly if they ſeek for true paſtors indeede, why do they forſake the biſhops and preeſts of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> which indeed haue both the calling,, and exequute the function of true Biſhops and paſtors, and runne after theſe wolues, murdrers and deuourers of Chriſt's ſheepe?</p>
                  <p>Fiftly they offer <hi>to anſwere perſon for perſon, and life for life for</hi> the fidelity of theire preeſts to his maieſty, <hi>and the state.</hi> But what if the preeſts abſolue traitors, and perſwade them to rebellion? where ſhall the ſtate ſeecke either for the parties or ſureties? And what ſhall it auaile to ſue the bonds? Agayne what a ridiculous conceite is this to thinke that the bonds of euery two or three baſe compagnions will be ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to ſecure either the life of ſo greate a king, or the peace and ſtate of ſo greate a kingdome againſt men alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy found perfidious? Thirdly it will be a queſtion, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther if ſuch a matter were to be performed, euery pild crow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned preeſt could procure ſuch hoſtages and bondes as are offered. it may be ſome good old Ladyes and recuſant Cuckowes would offer any bond for their darlinges. But the wiſer ſort, J thinke, woulde neuer put their liues in ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard vpon the maſſepreeſts promiſes, who if the pope com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand them to doe an exployt for their holy mother the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of fornications, regard neither promiſe, nor oath.</p>
                  <p>Finally it may be a queſtion, whether any ſuch bonds are good in lawe, and percaſe theſe good fellowes knowing them to be nought, are the bolder to offer them, thinking to gull the worlde with theire greate offers.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fiftly</hi> comming to the poynt of their pretended ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion they playnely refuſe to ſubmitte themſelues offring rather articles of a capitulation betwixt the King and them, then any forme of true ſubiection or ſubmiſſion, for firſte they ſay, <hi>they will acknowledge his maiesty to bee their lawfull King and ſouerein Lord, and will defend his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iesties
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:177776:75"/>heires and ſucceſſors righte.</hi> And for this his maieſty is much beholding to them. But we muſt vnderſtand, howe this offer is made vpon condition, if they may haue theire maſſe and theire Maſſe preeſts. if they may not haue theire requeſts, then they neither ſubmit themſelues, nor offer any thing. Further they acknowledge more then by the doct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine of popery they can make good. For by the chapter <hi>v. nam ſanctam. extr. de maior. &amp; obed.</hi> all kings are declared to be ſubiect to the pope. They do alſo deny the kings autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity in Eccleſiaſticall cauſes, and offer many preiudices to the Kings righte, both ouer the Clergy and others, and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge him no further to be their lawfull king, then it ſhall pleaſe the Pope, who hath power to excommunicate him and depoſe him, as they ſay. <hi>Laſtly</hi> where they ſpeake of the Kings ſucceſſors right, they forget to mention the kings righte. But what ſhould wee ſtand vpon future coniectures, when the treaſons of Watſon, Clerk, Garnet, Hamond and the reſt haue plainely declared them to bee the kinges ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myes?</p>
                  <p>Secondly they promiſe <hi>to reueale, and to theire powers to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand and preuent any conſpiracy, or treaſon agaynſt the King and his heires, and to defend the realm againſt forrein inuaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</hi> But miſerable were the King and ſtate, if they ſhold de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend vpon their reuelations, and withſtandings of treaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble attempts and invaſions, that are ſworne to the pope &amp; depend vpon forrein enemies. Former practiſes and expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience ſheweth, that their words and promiſes are but ſnares to catch ſuch as truſt them, of late they ſmothered the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of Percy and Cateſby as much as they could, &amp; ſoughte by all meanes to haue their country ſet on a flame. They ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge to his maieſty, <hi>what is due by the word of god, or hath been vſed</hi> by any of their ſect. but of the word of god they make the Pope ſupreme iudge, and vſe to deny obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to Kings excommunicate by him, nay to Kings not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicate, in eccleſiaſticall cauſes, what they meane to performe it appeareth by Watſons and Percies treaſons.</p>

                     <hi>Lastly</hi> they ſay they will performe this, by <hi>proteſtati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or oath,</hi> and offer the like for their preeſtes. But what are oathes and promiſes, when they ſay the pope can diſpenſe with oathes, and teach that faith is not to bee performed to hereticks, in which rank theſe ſuperſtitious miniſters of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſte place all true Chriſtians?

This al chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians ought to performe, and theſe eſpecially, that haue emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent places both in church and common wealth.

                     <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE Lords, no doubte, looked for thanks for their gentle and milde courſe taken with theſe maſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preeſts. if they looked for none, yet his maieſty de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued at their hands both thanks and praiſes, that gaue them life, who had ſo well deſerued death, and though he ſent them out of <hi>England;</hi> yet did ſend them into no place but whether they had fled before voluntarily of themſelues. But ſee the malicious diſpoſition, <hi>I</hi> pray you, of this vipe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous generation. For thankes to the Lords they ſend reprofes and expoſtulations, &amp; direct their letters to the lords, as thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the king to be no king, nor worthy to be written vnto by ſuch glorious creatures of antichriſt, as they take them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues to be.</p>
                  <p>They ſuppoſe, that they haue written wiſely &amp; pithily. But of that me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> may the better eſteem by theſe particulers. Firſt they ſay <hi>they haue ſuffred for christ his ſake and the profeſſion of the true catholike religion, which he pla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted with his precious bloud.</hi> But this is a groſſe ſlander to the ſtate, and to his maieſty prin<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cipally, who is here charged with perſequuting <hi>Chriſt,</hi> &amp; the <hi>true catholike religion.</hi> Further the ſame is a moſt impudent and vntrue aſſertion. For neither did <hi>Chriſt</hi> plant nor wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the maſſe, nor the worſhip of ſaints and images, nor the popes triple crown with his blood, nor is popery Catholike religion, nor did theſe fellows ſuffer for their ſuperſtitious &amp; falſe opinion, vnleſſe the ſame drew them into practiſe of treaſon, and made them to fetch their greaſy ordination from forreign enemies, and to depend vpon them, and to ioyn with them in ſeeking to blow vp the ſtate.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly</hi> they pretend to haue been <hi>depriued of all world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly comforts &amp; commodityes.</hi> But the author of the quodlibers ſaith no, and the world knoweth, how they haue dominee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in the places of their reſiance, and liued with all plenty, eaſe and contentment in priſon. Gerrard and Garnet are fat
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:177776:78"/>and well liking, and neuer did men enioy more worldly delightes.</p>

                  <p n="5">5. They ſay <hi>theire baniſhment is an vndeſerued penalty.</hi> But the lawes of <hi>England</hi> ſay they deſerued death: and their trea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſons prooue it. are not then fauors well beſtowed on theſe treacherous and murmuring fellowes?</p>
                  <p n="6">6.

                  <p n="7">7. They tell vs of the diuers qualityes of the Maſſepreeſtes baniſhed. But what is that to the purpoſe, ſeeing none wold reuounce intelligences with forreigne enemyes, nor acknow<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ledge the kings ſupreme authority? Further they cannot prooue, that they haue any good qualities, being ſo farre in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged in Percyes conſpiracy, and other practiſes.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. They ſignify, that they purpoſe agayn to return into their country. But how agreeth this with their former proteſtati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of ſuffering with patience and humility? agayn why ſhold
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:177776:78"/>they intrude themſelues, where no man ſendeth for the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>? why ſhold they thruſt the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues in amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g true paſtors, being ordei<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ned by Antichriſt to ſacrifice for quick &amp; dead? &amp; why ſhold wolues be ſuffered to entre within <hi>Chriſts</hi> fold, hereticks a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong Chriſtians, trecherous compagnions among the kings loyall ſubiects?</p>
                  <p n="9">9. They pray their honors to <hi>conceiue of them, as of men, that haue the fear and grace of god before their eies, and the ſincere loue of their prince and country in their harts.</hi> But their doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trines, actions and practiſes doe vtterly remooue this conceit both out of the minds of the councell &amp; of others. Som parti<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>culers of their dooings we haue touched before. the treaſon of Cateſby and Percy toucheth them at the very hart.</p>
                  <p>Finally they call them ſelues <hi>his maieſties true and loyall ſubiects.</hi> But how true, it appeared firſt in the practiſes of Clerke and Watſon, hanged at <hi>Winchester</hi> not lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g ſence, and next in the attempt of Percy and his complices, diuers of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> being abſolued and reſolued by maſſepreeſts in their wicked purpoſes, and generally in the doctrine of maſſepreeſts a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the authority of Kings before mentioned, and in their combinations and intelligences with the pope &amp; other tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors and forreine enemies, as <hi>Parſons,</hi> and the popiſh cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals and ſuch like. What then remayneth, but that ſuch as finde them ſelues agreeued with the ſentence of baniſhme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, ſhould haue the ſente<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of the law, and that ſuch as loue the Pope and Jtaly better then the King and their owne coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, ſhould be forced to liue with theyr holy father in their Italian <hi>Babylon?</hi> god grant that neither Prince nor country receiue harme by their return, or by any of their aſſociates or companions.
